</div>

<p>Katherine Mansfield died at
Fontainebleau on January 9th 1923, at
the age of thirty-four.</p>

<p>This volume contains all the complete stories,
and several fragments of stories, which she wrote
at the same time as, or after, those published in
“The Garden Party and Other Stories.” Her
earlier work, belonging to the period between her
first book, “In a German Pension,” and her second,
“Bliss and Other Stories,” will be published
in one or two separate volumes in a collected
edition of her work. Thus the continuity of her
writing will be preserved, and an opportunity
given to those who care for such things to follow
the development of a talent now generally recognised
as among the rarest of her generation.</p>

<p>The title of this volume, “The Doves’ Nest and
Other Stories,” is the title which Katherine
Mansfield intended to give it. Whether the stories
which compose it are those which she would
finally have included in it, I cannot say. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
standard of self-criticism was continually changing,
and changing always in the direction of a
greater rigour. In writings which I thought perfect
she, with her keener insight, discerned
unworthy elements. Now that I am forced to depend
upon my own sole judgment, it has seemed
to me that there is not a scrap of her writing—not
even the tiniest fragment—during this final period
which does not bear the visible impress of her
exquisite individuality and her creative power.</p>

<p>On October 27, 1921, soon after she had finished
and sent to her publisher the stories which
compose “The Garden Party,” she wrote the following
plan of her new book in her journal.
(The letters L. and N. Z. mean that the stories
were to have London or New Zealand for their
setting.)</p>

<p>Of these stories only the one called <cite>At Karori</cite>
and subsequently entitled <cite>The Doll’s House</cite> was
finished, three days later, on October 30. Of
some of the remaining stories there are considerable
fragments, of three of them I have so far
discovered no trace at all. All the fragments I
have found which indubitably belong to any of
these stories I have included in this volume. I
have also included other fragments which seemed
to possess a separate existence, but I have reserved
most of the shorter pieces for publication
with her Journal.</p>

<p>Between October 1921, when the original plan
of this volume was sketched, and the end of
January 1922, she finished other stories which she
had not foreseen. These were <cite>A Cup of Tea</cite>,
<cite>Honeymoon</cite>, <cite>Taking the Veil</cite>, and the long, unfinished,
yet somehow complete piece, <cite>A Married
Man’s Story</cite>. In January she also began <cite>The
Doves’ Nest</cite>, a story which was particularly important
to her, and with the writing of which—at
least at the beginning—she was satisfied. She
wrote in her Journal on New Year’s Day, 1922:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Wrote <cite>The Doves’ Nest</cite> this afternoon. I was
in no mood to write; it seemed impossible. Yet,
when I had finished three pages, they ‘were all
right!’ This is a proof (never to be too often
proved) that when one has thought out a story
nothing remains but the <em>labour</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>She worked on and off at <cite>The Doves’ Nest</cite> during
the following summer also. Unfortunately
I can find no trace of her own manuscript. There
is a fair, clean copy, typewritten by herself, of the
portion printed in this book, but nothing more.</p>

<p>In February 1922 began three months of an exacting
medical treatment in Paris, during which
work became more and more a physical impossibility.
Nevertheless, at the beginning of this
time, on February 20th, she wrote <cite>The Fly</cite>. On
her return to Switzerland in June she tried to resume
work on <cite>The Doves’ Nest</cite> and she wrote the
scenario of a play; but again physical weakness
made work in the mountains impossible. To ease
the strain on her heart she descended into the
valley in June. At Sierre she wrote more of <cite>The
Doves’ Nest</cite>, much more, alas, than remains; she
also began the unfinished piece called <cite>Father and
the Girls</cite> and finished the short story called <cite>The
Canary</cite>. These were the last of the stories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
written by her which can be exactly dated. There
is reason, however, to believe that the passage of
the story called <cite>Six Years After</cite> which ends with
the words: “Can one do nothing for the dead?
And for a long time the answer had been—Nothing!”
was actually the last piece written by her.
It seems to belong to the autumn of 1922, when
she had, for a time, practically abandoned
writing.</p>

<p>It was not, however, because of her physical
weakness that she stopped writing in the late
summer of 1922. The power of her spirit to
triumph over the frailty of her body had been
proved over and over again. She stopped writing
deliberately, not under compulsion. She felt
that her whole attitude to life needed to be renewed,
and she determined that she would write
no more until it had been renewed.</p>

<p>Perhaps an idea of the way her mind—or
rather her whole being—was moving, may be
gleaned from some extracts from her journal. At
first, her dissatisfaction with her work took shape
in a feeling that she was not exerting the whole
of her powers or expressing the whole of her
knowledge in her writings. As early as July 1921,
when she was still engaged on the last of the
stories for “The Garden Party,” she wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>July 1921. I finished <cite>Mr. and Mrs. Dove</cite> yesterday.
I am not altogether pleased with it.
It’s a little bit made up. It’s not inevitable. I
meant to imply that those two may not be happy
together—that that is the kind of reason for
which a young girl marries. But have I done so?
I don’t think so. Besides it’s not <em>strong</em> enough.
I want to be nearer—far nearer than that. I
want to use all my force, even when I am taking a
fine line. And I have a sneaking notion that I
have, at the end, used the doves <em>unwarrantably</em>.
Tu sais ce que je veux dire. I used them to round
off something—didn’t I? Is that quite my game?
No, it’s not. It’s not quite the kind of truth I’m
after. Now for <cite>Susannah</cite>. All must be <em>deeply
felt</em>.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And a few days later she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>July 23. Finished <cite>An Ideal Family</cite> yesterday.
It seems to me better than the <cite>Doves</cite>, but still it’s
not good enough. I worked at it hard enough,
God knows, and yet I didn’t get the deepest truth
out of the idea, even once. What is this feeling?
I feel again that this kind of knowledge is too
easy for me; it’s even a kind of trickery. I know
so much more. It looks and smells like a story,
but I wouldn’t buy it. I don’t want to possess it—to
live with it. <em>No.</em> Once I have written two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
more, I shall tackle something different—a long
story—<cite>At the Bay</cite>, with more <em>difficult</em> relationships.
That’s the whole problem.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet a little later her vision of the cause of her
own dissatisfaction deepened, and she began to define
it in terms—of the insufficient clarity of her
own spirit, and of the incompleteness of her inward
life—which were to become more and more
familiar.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Well, I must confess I have had an idle day—God
knows why. All was to be written, but I
just didn’t write it. I thought I would, but I felt
tired after tea, and rested instead. Is it good or
bad in me to behave so? I have a sense of guilt,
but at the same time I know that to rest is the
very best thing I can do. And for some reason
there is a kind of booming in my head—which is
horrid. But marks of earthly degradation still
pursue me. I am not crystal clear. Above all
else, I do still lack application. It’s not right.
There is so much to do, and I do so little. Look
at the stories that wait and wait, just at the
threshold. Why don’t I let them in? And their
place would be taken by others who are lurking
beyond, just out there—waiting for the chance.</p>

<p>Next day. Yet take this morning, for instance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
I don’t want to write anything. It’s grey; it’s
heavy and dull. And short stories seem unreal,
and not worth doing. I don’t want to write? I
want to <em>live</em>. What does one mean by that? It’s
not too easy to say. But there you are!</p>

<p>Aug. 21. All this that I write, all that I am,
is on the border of the sea. It’s a kind of playing.
I want to put all my force behind it, but
somehow I <em>cannot</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>And again in the autumn of the year her incessant
effort towards an inward purity—who but
she would have dreamed that she lacked it?—as
a condition of soul essential to writing as she purposed
to write, becomes still more manifest.</p>

my last story, <cite>The Garden Party</cite>, which I finished
on my birthday. It took me nearly a month to
‘recover’ from <cite>At the Bay</cite>. I made at least four
false starts. But I could not get away from the
sound of the sea and Beryl fanning her hair at the
window. These things would not <em>die down</em>. But
now I am not at all sure about that story. It
seems to me it is a little ‘wispy’—not what it
might have been. The <cite>G. P.</cite> is better. But that
is not <em>good enough</em>, either.... The last few
days, what one notices more than anything is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
blue. Blue sky, blue mountains—all is a heavenly
blueness! And clouds of all kinds—wings, soft
white clouds, almost hard little golden islands,
great mock-mountains. The gold deepens on the
slopes. In fact, in sober fact, it is perfection.
But the late evening is the time of times.
Then, with that unearthly beauty before one, it
is not hard to realize how far one has to go. To
write something that will be worthy of that rising
moon, that pale light. To be ‘simple’ enough as
one would be simple before God.</p>

<p>Nov. 21. Since then I have only written <cite>The
Doll’s House</cite>. A bad spell has been on me. I
have begun two stories, but then told them and
they felt betrayed. It is absolutely fatal to give
way to this temptation.... Today I begin to
write, seriously, <cite>The Weak Heart</cite>—a story which
fascinates me <em>deeply</em>. What I feel it needs so
peculiarly is a very subtle variation of tense from
the present to the past and back again—and softness,
lightness, and the feeling that all is in bud,
with a play of humour over the character of Roddie.
And the feeling of the Thorndon Baths,
the wet, moist, oozy ... no, I know how it must
be done.</p>

<p>May I be found worthy to do it! Lord, make
me crystal clear for thy light to shine through.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>The two stories which she told and then was
forced to abandon “because they felt betrayed”
were <cite>Honesty</cite> and <cite>All Serene</cite>. Of <cite>Weak Heart</cite>,
as she subsequently called it, only fragments remain.
There is the opening copied in careful
writing, a few hurriedly written sentences from
the middle—themes, as it were, hastily noted—and
then, obviously written at top speed and decipherable
only with great difficulty, the end.</p>

<p>The two following passages from her journal
belong to the same months, October and November
1921. But they were written in another
book, and one of them should be placed in point
of time between the two previous entries.
Katherine Mansfield’s attempts at keeping a
regular journal were intermittent. Nearly all the
passages quoted here as from her “journal” were
written on random pages of the little copy-books
in which she composed her stories. In order to
appreciate the first of the following passages
fully it should be remembered that it was written
immediately after she had finished <cite>At the Bay</cite>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Oct. 1921. I wonder why it should be so
difficult to be humble. I do not think I am a good
writer; I realise my faults better than any one else
could realise them. I know exactly when I fail.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
And yet, when I have finished a story and before
I have begun another, I catch myself <em>preening</em>
my feathers. It is disheartening. There seems
to be some bad old pride in my heart; a root of it
that puts out a thick shoot on the slightest provocation....
This interferes very much with
work. One can’t be calm, clear, good as one must
be, while it goes on. I look at the mountains, I
try to pray—and I think of something <em>clever</em>.
It’s a kind of excitement within one which
shouldn’t be there. Calm yourself. Clear yourself.
And anything that I write in this mood will
be no good; it will be full of <em>sediment</em>. If I were
well, I would go off by myself somewhere and sit
under a tree. One must learn, one must practice
to <em>forget</em> oneself. I can’t tell the truth about
Aunt Anne unless I am free to enter into her life
without self-consciousness. Oh, God! I am divided
still, I am bad, I fail in my personal life.
I lapse into impatience, temper, vanity, and so I
fail as thy priest. Perhaps poetry will help.</p>

<p>I have just thoroughly cleaned and attended
to my fountain pen. If after this it leaks, then
it is <em>no</em> gentleman!</p>

<p>Nov. 13, 1921. It is time I started a new journal.
Come my unseen, my unknown, let us talk
together. Yes, for the last two weeks I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
written scarcely anything. I have been idle;
I have <em>failed</em>. Why? Many reasons. There
has been a kind of confusion in my consciousness.
It has seemed as though there was no time to
write. The mornings, if they are sunny, are
taken up with sun-treatment; the post eats away
the afternoon. And at night I am tired. But it
goes deeper. Yes, you are right. I haven’t felt
able to yield to the kind of contemplation that is
necessary. I haven’t felt pure in heart, not
humble, not good. There’s been a stirring up of
sediment. I look at the mountains and I see nothing
but mountains. Be frank! I read rubbish....
Out of hand? Yes, that describes it. Dissipated,
vague, not <em>positive</em>, and above all, above
everything, not working as I should be working—wasting
time.</p>

<p>Wasting time! The old cry—the first and last
cry. Why do ye tarry? Ah, why indeed? My
deepest desire is to be a writer, to have “a body
of work” done—and there the work is, there the
stories wait for me, <em>grow tired</em>, wilt, fade, because
I will not come. When first they knock,
how eager and fresh they are! And I hear and
I <em>acknowledge</em> them, and still I go on sitting at
the window, playing with the ball of wool. What
is to be done?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>I must make another effort at once. I must
begin all over again. I must try and write
simply, fully, freely, from my heart. <em>Quietly</em>,
caring nothing for success or failure, but just going
on....</p>

<p>But now to resolve! And especially to keep
in touch with life. With the sky, this moon,
these stars, these cold candid peaks.</p>

</div>

<p>During the following summer at Sierre in
Switzerland one could have believed that Katherine
Mansfield had finally accomplished the task
of inward purification she had set herself, and to
me it seems that there is a halcyon clarity and
calm diffused through the unfinished stories written
there. But she was still secretly dissatisfied
with herself and her work, and in the autumn,
after a brief return to London, she deliberately
decided to risk everything, to abandon the writing
that was dearer than all else to her, in order
to achieve that newness of heart without which
her work and her life seemed to her unprofitable.
At the end of October she retired, by herself, to
a settlement at Fontainebleau, where she found
what she sought. A few days after she had taken
this final step, she wrote in a letter:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“No treatment on earth is any good to me
really. It’s all pretence. M. did make me heavier
and a trifle stronger. But that was all, if
I really face the facts. The miracle never came
near happening. It couldn’t. And as for my
spirit—well as a result of that life at the Victoria-Palace
I stopped being a writer. I have only
written long or short scraps since <cite>The Fly</cite>. If
I had gone on with my old life, I never would have
written again, for I was dying of poverty of life.</p>

<p>I wish, when one writes about things, one
didn’t dramatize them so. I feel awfully happy
about all this—And it’s all as simple as can
be....</p>

<p>But in any case I shan’t write any stories for
three months, and I’ll not have a book ready before
the spring. It doesn’t matter....”</p>

</div>

<p>And again, in reply to a friend who pleaded
with her not to abandon writing, she wrote, on
October 26:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As for writing stories and being true to
one’s gift—I could not write them if I were not
here, even. I am at an end of my source for a
time. Life has brought me no <em>flow</em>. I want to
write, but differently,—far more steadily.”</p>

</div>

<p>She believed that she could not express the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
change that had taken place in her even in letters,
though indeed her letters were radiant with happiness:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And yet I realize as I write, all this is no use.
An old personality is trying to get back to the outside
and observe, and it’s not true to the facts at
all. What I write seems so petty. In fact I cannot
express myself in writing just now. The old
mechanism isn’t mine any longer and I can’t control
the new. I just have to talk this baby talk.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I am not in the mood for books at present,”
she wrote finally, shortly before Christmas,
“though I know that in future I shall want to
write them more than anything else. But different
books.”</p>

<p>What those “different books” would have been
we shall never know. She was seized by a sudden
and fatal haemorrhage on the evening of
January 9th. She is buried in the communal
cemetery of Avon near Fontainebleau. On her
gravestone are inscribed the words of Shakespeare
she chose for the title-page of “Bliss,”
words which had long been cherished by her and
were to prove prophetic:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle,
danger, we pluck this flower, safety.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DOLLS_HOUSE">THE DOLL’S HOUSE</h2>

</div>

<p>When dear old Mrs. Hay went
back to town after staying with the
Burnells she sent the children a
doll’s house. It was so big that the carter and
Pat carried it into the courtyard, and there it
stayed, propped up on two wooden boxes beside
the feed-room door. No harm could come
to it; it was summer. And perhaps the smell
of paint would have gone off by the time it had
to be taken in. For, really, the smell of paint
coming from that doll’s house (“Sweet of old
Mrs. Hay, of course; most sweet and generous!”)—but
the smell of paint was quite enough
to make any one seriously ill, in Aunt Beryl’s
opinion. Even before the sacking was taken
off. And when it was....</p>

<p>There stood the doll’s house, a dark, oily,
spinach green, picked out with bright yellow.
Its two solid little chimneys, glued on to the
roof, were painted red and white, and the door,
gleaming with yellow varnish, was like a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
slab of toffee. Four windows, real windows,
were divided into panes by a broad streak of
green. There was actually a tiny porch, too,
painted yellow, with big lumps of congealed paint
hanging along the edge.</p>

<p>But perfect, perfect little house! Who could
possibly mind the smell? It was part of the joy,
part of the newness.</p>

<p>“Open it quickly, some one!”</p>

<p>The hook at the side was stuck fast. Pat
pried it open with his penknife, and the whole
house-front swung back, and—there you were,
gazing at one and the same moment into the
drawing-room and dining-room, the kitchen and
two bedrooms. That is the way for a house to
open! Why don’t all houses open like that?
How much more exciting than peering through
the slit of a door into a mean little hall with a
hatstand and two umbrellas! That is—isn’t it?—what
you long to know about a house when you
put your hand on the knocker. Perhaps it is the
way God opens houses at dead of night when He
is taking a quiet turn with an angel....</p>

<p>“O-oh!” The Burnell children sounded as
though they were in despair. It was too marvellous;
it was too much for them. They had never
seen anything like it in their lives. All the rooms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
were papered. There were pictures on the walls,
painted on the paper, with gold frames complete.
Red carpet covered all the floors except the
kitchen; red plush chairs in the drawing-room,
green in the dining-room; tables, beds with real
bedclothes, a cradle, a stove, a dresser with tiny
plates and one big jug. But what Kezia liked
more than anything, what she liked frightfully,
was the lamp. It stood in the middle of the
dining-room table, an exquisite little amber lamp
with a white globe. It was even filled all ready
for lighting, though, of course, you couldn’t light
it. But there was something inside that looked
like oil, and that moved when you shook it.</p>

<p>The father and mother dolls, who sprawled
very stiff as though they had fainted in the drawing-room,
and their two little children asleep upstairs,
were really too big for the doll’s house.
They didn’t look as though they belonged. But
the lamp was perfect. It seemed to smile at
Kezia, to say, “I live here.” The lamp was
real.</p>

<p>The Burnell children could hardly walk to
school fast enough the next morning. They
burned to tell everybody, to describe, to—well—to
boast about their doll’s house before the
school-bell rang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“I’m to tell,” said Isabel, “because I’m the
eldest. And you two can join in after. But
I’m to tell first.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to answer. Isabel was
bossy, but she was always right, and Lottie and
Kezia knew too well the powers that went with
being eldest. They brushed through the thick
buttercups at the road edge and said nothing.</p>

<p>“And I’m to choose who’s to come and see it
first. Mother said I might.”</p>

<p>For it had been arranged that while the doll’s
house stood in the courtyard they might ask the
girls at school, two at a time, to come and look.
Not to stay to tea, of course, or to come traipsing
through the house. But just to stand quietly in
the courtyard while Isabel pointed out the beauties,
and Lottie and Kezia looked pleased....</p>

<p>But hurry as they might, by the time they had
reached the tarred palings of the boys’ playground
the bell had begun to jangle. They only
just had time to whip off their hats and fall into
line before the roll was called. Never mind.
Isabel tried to make up for it by looking very important
and mysterious and by whispering behind
her hand to the girls near her, “Got something
to tell you at playtime.”</p>

<p>Playtime came and Isabel was surrounded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
The girls of her class nearly fought to put their
arms round her, to walk away with her, to beam
flatteringly, to be her special friend. She held
quite a court under the huge pine trees at the
side of the playground. Nudging, giggling together,
the little girls pressed up close. And the
only two who stayed outside the ring were the two
who were always outside, the little Kelveys.
They knew better than to come anywhere near
the Burnells.</p>

<p>For the fact was, the school the Burnell children
went to was not at all the kind of place their
parents would have chosen if there had been any
choice. But there was none. It was the only
school for miles. And the consequence was all
the children in the neighbourhood, the Judge’s
little girls, the doctor’s daughters, the store-keeper’s
children, the milkman’s, were forced to
mix together. Not to speak of there being an
equal number of rude, rough little boys as well.
But the line had to be drawn somewhere. It
was drawn at the Kelveys. Many of the children,
including the Burnells, were not allowed
even to speak to them. They walked past the
Kelveys with their heads in the air, and as they
set the fashion in all matters of behaviour, the
Kelveys were shunned by everybody. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
teacher had a special voice for them, and a special
smile for the other children when Lil Kelvey
came up to her desk with a bunch of dreadfully
common-looking flowers.</p>

<p>They were the daughters of a spry, hardworking
little washerwoman, who went about from
house to house by the day. This was awful
enough. But where was Mr. Kelvey? Nobody
knew for certain. But everybody said he was in
prison. So they were the daughters of a washerwoman
and a gaolbird. Very nice company for
other people’s children! And they looked it.
Why Mrs. Kelvey made them so conspicuous was
hard to understand. The truth was they were
dressed in “bits” given to her by the people for
whom she worked. Lil, for instance, who was
a stout, plain child, with big freckles, came to
school in a dress made from a green art-serge
table-cloth of the Burnells’, with red plush sleeves
from the Logans’ curtains. Her hat, perched on
top of her high forehead, was a grown-up woman’s
hat, once the property of Miss Lecky, the
postmistress. It was turned up at the back and
trimmed with a large scarlet quill. What a little
guy she looked! It was impossible not to
laugh. And her little sister, our Else, wore a
long white dress, rather like a nightgown, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
a pair of little boy’s boots. But whatever our
Else wore she would have looked strange. She
was a tiny wishbone of a child, with cropped hair
and enormous solemn eyes—a little white owl.
Nobody had ever seen her smile; she scarcely
ever spoke. She went through life holding on to
Lil, with a piece of Lil’s skirt screwed up in her
hand. Where Lil went our Else followed. In
the playground, on the road going to and from
school, there was Lil marching in front and our
Else holding on behind. Only when she wanted
anything, or when she was out of breath, our
Else gave Lil a tug, a twitch, and Lil stopped
and turned round. The Kelveys never failed to
understand each other.</p>

<p>Now they hovered at the edge; you couldn’t
stop them listening. When the little girls turned
round and sneered, Lil, as usual, gave her silly,
shamefaced smile, but our Else only looked.</p>

<p>And Isabel’s voice, so very proud, went on
telling. The carpet made a great sensation, but
so did the beds with real bedclothes, and the stove
with an oven door.</p>

<p>When she finished Kezia broke in. “You’ve
forgotten the lamp, Isabel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Isabel, “and there’s a teeny
little lamp, all made of yellow glass, with a white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
globe that stands on the dining-room table. You
couldn’t tell it from a real one.”</p>

<p>“The lamp’s best of all,” cried Kezia. She
thought Isabel wasn’t making half enough of the
little lamp. But nobody paid any attention.
Isabel was choosing the two who were to come
back with them that afternoon and see it. She
chose Emmie Cole and Lena Logan. But when
the others knew they were all to have a chance,
they couldn’t be nice enough to Isabel. One by
one they put their arms round Isabel’s waist and
walked her off. They had something to whisper
to her, a secret. “Isabel’s <em>my</em> friend.”</p>

<p>Only the little Kelveys moved away forgotten;
there was nothing more for them to hear.</p>

<p class="tb">Days passed, and as more children saw the
doll’s house, the fame of it spread. It became
the one subject, the rage. The one question was,
“Have you seen Burnells’ doll’s house? Oh,
ain’t it lovely!” “Haven’t you seen it? Oh, I
say!”</p>

<p>Even the dinner hour was given up to talking
about it. The little girls sat under the pines eating
their thick mutton sandwiches and big slabs of
johnny cake spread with butter. While always,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
as near as they could get, sat the Kelveys, our
Else holding on to Lil, listening too, while they
chewed their jam sandwiches out of a newspaper
soaked with large red blobs....</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Kezia, “can’t I ask the Kelveys
just once?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, Kezia.”</p>

<p>“But why not?”</p>

<p>“Run away, Kezia; you know quite well why
not.”</p>

<p class="tb">At last everybody had seen it except them. On
that day the subject rather flagged. It was the
dinner hour. The children stood together under
the pine trees, and suddenly, as they looked at
the Kelveys eating out of their paper, always
by themselves, always listening, they wanted to
be horrid to them. Emmie Cole started the
whisper.</p>

<p>“Lil Kelvey’s going to be a servant when she
grows up.”</p>

<p>“O-oh, how awful!” said Isabel Burnell, and
she made eyes at Emmie.</p>

<p>Emmie swallowed in a very meaning way and
nodded to Isabel as she’d seen her mother do on
those occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“It’s true—it’s true—it’s true,” she said.</p>

<p>Then Lena Logan’s little eyes snapped.
“Shall I ask her?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Bet you don’t,” said Jessie May.</p>

<p>“Pooh, I’m not frightened,” said Lena. Suddenly
she gave a little squeal and danced in front
of the other girls. “Watch! Watch me!
Watch me now!” said Lena. And sliding, gliding,
dragging one foot, giggling behind her hand,
Lena went over to the Kelveys.</p>

<p>Lil looked up from her dinner. She wrapped
the rest quickly away. Our Else stopped chewing.
What was coming now?</p>

<p>“Is it true you’re going to be a servant when
you grow up, Lil Kelvey?” shrilled Lena.</p>

<p>Dead silence. But instead of answering, Lil
only gave her silly, shamefaced smile. She didn’t
seem to mind the question at all. What a sell
for Lena! The girls began to titter.</p>

<p>Lena couldn’t stand that. She put her hands
on her hips; she shot forward. “Yah, yer father’s
in prison!” she hissed, spitefully.</p>

<p>This was such a marvellous thing to have said
that the little girls rushed away in a body, deeply,
deeply excited, wild with joy. Some one found
a long rope, and they began skipping. And
never did they skip so high, run in and out so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
fast, or do such daring things as on that morning.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Pat called for the Burnell
children with the buggy and they drove home.
There were visitors. Isabel and Lottie, who
liked visitors, went upstairs to change their pinafores.
But Kezia thieved out at the back. Nobody
was about; she began to swing on the big
white gates of the courtyard. Presently, looking
along the road, she saw two little dots. They
grew bigger, they were coming towards her.
Now she could see that one was in front and one
close behind. Now she could see that they were
the Kelveys. Kezia stopped swinging. She
slipped off the gate as if she was going to run
away. Then she hesitated. The Kelveys came
nearer, and beside them walked their shadows,
very long, stretching right across the road with
their heads in the buttercups. Kezia clambered
back on the gate; she had made up her mind; she
swung out.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” she said to the passing Kelveys.</p>

<p>They were so astounded that they stopped.
Lil gave her silly smile. Our Else stared.</p>

<p>“You can come and see our doll’s house if you
want to,” said Kezia, and she dragged one toe
on the ground. But at that Lil turned red and
shook her head quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Kezia.</p>

<p>Lil gasped, then she said, “Your ma told our
ma you wasn’t to speak to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Kezia. She didn’t know what
to reply. “It doesn’t matter. You can come
and see our doll’s house all the same. Come
on. Nobody’s looking.”</p>

<p>But Lil shook her head still harder.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to?” asked Kezia.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a twitch, a tug at Lil’s
skirt. She turned round. Our Else was looking
at her with big, imploring eyes; she was frowning;
she wanted to go. For a moment Lil looked at
our Else very doubtfully. But then our Else
twitched her skirt again. She started forward.
Kezia led the way. Like two little stray cats
they followed across the courtyard to where the
doll’s house stood.</p>

<p>“There it is,” said Kezia.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Lil breathed loudly, almost
snorted; our Else was still as a stone.</p>

<p>“I’ll open it for you,” said Kezia kindly. She
undid the hook and they looked inside.</p>

<p>“There’s the drawing-room and the dining-room,
and that’s the—”</p>

<p>“Kezia!”</p>

<p>Oh, what a start they gave!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Kezia!”</p>

<p>It was Aunt Beryl’s voice. They turned
round. At the back door stood Aunt Beryl, staring
as if she couldn’t believe what she saw.</p>

<p>“How dare you ask the little Kelveys into the
courtyard?” said her cold, furious voice. “You
know as well as I do, you’re not allowed to talk
to them. Run away, children, run away at once.
And don’t come back again,” said Aunt Beryl.
And she stepped into the yard and shooed them
out as if they were chickens.</p>

<p>“Off you go immediately!” she called, cold and
proud.</p>

<p>They did not need telling twice. Burning with
shame, shrinking together, Lil huddling along
like her mother, our Else dazed, somehow they
crossed the big courtyard and squeezed through
the white gate.</p>

<p>“Wicked, disobedient little girl!” said Aunt
Beryl bitterly to Kezia, and she slammed the
doll’s house to.</p>

<p>The afternoon had been awful. A letter had
come from Willie Brent, a terrifying, threatening
letter, saying if she did not meet him that
evening in Pulman’s Bush, he’d come to the front
door and ask the reason why! But now that she
had frightened those little rats of Kelveys and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
given Kezia a good scolding, her heart felt
lighter. That ghastly pressure was gone. She
went back to the house humming.</p>

<p>When the Kelveys were well out of sight of
Burnells’, they sat down to rest on a big red drain-pipe
by the side of the road. Lil’s cheeks were
still burning; she took off the hat with the quill
and held it on her knee. Dreamily they looked
over the hay paddocks, past the creek, to the
group of wattles where Logan’s cows stood waiting
to be milked. What were their thoughts?</p>

<p>Presently our Else nudged up close to her
sister. But now she had forgotten the cross
lady. She put out a finger and stroked her sister’s
quill; she smiled her rare smile.</p>

<p>“I seen the little lamp,” she said, softly.</p>

<p>Then both were silent once more.</p>

</div>

<p>And when they came out of the lace shop
there was their own driver and the cab
they called their own cab waiting for
them under a plane tree. What luck! Wasn’t
it luck? Fanny pressed her husband’s arm.
These things seemed always to be happening to
them ever since they—came abroad. Didn’t he
think so too? But George stood on the pavement
edge, lifted his stick, and gave a loud “Hi!”
Fanny sometimes felt a little uncomfortable
about the way George summoned cabs, but the
drivers didn’t seem to mind, so it must have been
all right. Fat, good-natured, and smiling, they
stuffed away the little newspaper they were reading,
whipped the cotton cover off the horse, and
were ready to obey.</p>

<p>“I say,” George said as he helped Fanny in,
“suppose we go and have tea at the place where
the lobsters grow. Would you like to?”</p>

<p>“Most awfully,” said Fanny, fervently, as she
leaned back, wondering why the way George put
things made them sound so very nice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“R-right, <i lang="fr">bien</i>.” He was beside her. “<i lang="fr">Allay</i>,”
he cried gaily, and off they went.</p>

<p>Off they went, spanking along lightly, under
the green and gold shade of the plane trees,
through the small streets that smelled of lemons
and fresh coffee, past the fountain square where
women, with water-pots lifted, stopped talking to
gaze after them, round the corner past the café,
with its pink and white umbrellas, green tables,
and blue siphons, and so to the sea front. There
a wind, light, warm, came flowing over the boundless
sea. It touched George, and Fanny it
seemed to linger over while they gazed at the
dazzling water. And George said, “Jolly, isn’t
it?” And Fanny, looking dreamy, said, as she
said at least twenty times a day since they—came
abroad: “Isn’t it extraordinary to think
that here we are quite alone, away from everybody,
with nobody to tell us to go home, or to—to
order us about except ourselves?”</p>

<p>George had long since given up answering “Extraordinary!”
As a rule he merely kissed her.
But now he caught hold of her hand, stuffed it
into his pocket, pressed her fingers, and said, “I
used to keep a white mouse in my pocket when
I was a kid.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” said Fanny, who was intensely interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
in everything George had ever done.
“Were you very fond of white mice?”</p>

<p>“Fairly,” said George, without conviction. He
was looking at something, bobbing out there
beyond the bathing steps. Suddenly he almost
jumped in his seat. “Fanny!” he cried. “There’s
a chap out there bathing. Do you see? I’d no
idea people had begun. I’ve been missing it all
these days.” George glared at the reddened
face, the reddened arm, as though he could not
look away. “At any rate,” he muttered, “wild
horses won’t keep me from going in to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Fanny’s heart sank. She had heard for years
of the frightful dangers of the Mediterranean.
It was an absolute death-trap. Beautiful, treacherous
Mediterranean. There it lay curled before
them, its white, silky paws touching the
stones and gone again.... But she’d made up
her mind long before she was married that never
would she be the kind of woman who interfered
with her husband’s pleasures, so all she said was,
airily, “I suppose one has to be very up in the
currents, doesn’t one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said George. “People
talk an awful lot of rot about the danger.”</p>

<p>But now they were passing a high wall on the
land side, covered with flowering heliotrope, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Fanny’s little nose lifted. “Oh, George,” she
breathed. “The smell! The most divine....”</p>

<p>“Topping villa,” said George. “Look, you
can see it through the palms.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather large?” said Fanny, who somehow
could not look at any villa except as a possible
habitation for herself and George.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d need a crowd of people if you
stayed there long,” replied George. “Deadly,
otherwise. I say, it is ripping. I wonder who
it belongs to.” And he prodded the driver in
the back.</p>

<p>The lazy, smiling driver, who had no idea, replied,
as he always did on these occasions, that
it was the property of a wealthy Spanish family.</p>

<p>“Masses of Spaniards on this coast,” commented
George, leaning back again, and they
were silent until, as they rounded a bend, the
big, bone-white hotel-restaurant came into view.
Before it there was a small terrace built up
against the sea, planted with umbrella palms, set
out with tables, and at their approach, from the
terrace, from the hotel, waiters came running to
receive, to welcome, Fanny and George, to cut
them off from any possible kind of escape.</p>

<p>“Outside?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Oh, but of course they would sit outside. The
sleek manager, who was marvellously like a fish
in a frock coat, skimmed forward.</p>

<p>“Dis way, sir. Dis way, sir. I have a very
nice little table,” he gasped. “Just the little
table for you, sir, over in de corner. Dis way.”</p>

<p>So George, looking most dreadfully bored, and
Fanny, trying to look as though she’d spent years
of life threading her way through strangers, followed
after.</p>

<p>“Here you are, sir. Here you will be very
nice,” coaxed the manager, taking the vase off
the table, and putting it down again as if it were
a fresh little bouquet out of the air. But George
refused to sit down immediately. He saw
through these fellows; he wasn’t going to be
done. These chaps were always out to rush you.
So he put his hands in his pockets, and said to
Fanny, very calmly, “This all right for you?
Anywhere else you’d prefer? How about over
there?” And he nodded to a table right over
the other side.</p>

<p>What it was to be a man of the world! Fanny
admired him deeply, but all she wanted to do
was to sit down and look like everybody else.</p>

<p>“I—I like this,” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Right,” said George, hastily, and he sat down
almost before Fanny, and said quickly, “Tea for
two and chocolate éclairs.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said the manager, and his
mouth opened and shut as though he was ready
for another dive under the water. “You will
not ’ave toasts to start with? We ’ave very
nice toasts, sir.”</p>

<p>“No,” said George, shortly. “You don’t want
toast, do you, Fanny?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you, George,” said Fanny,
praying the manager would go.</p>

<p>“Or perhaps de lady might like to look at de
live lobsters in de tank while de tea is coming?”
And he grimaced and smirked and flicked his serviette
like a fin.</p>

<p>George’s face grew stony. He said “No”
again, and Fanny bent over the table, unbuttoning
her gloves. When she looked up the man
was gone. George took off his hat, tossed it
on to a chair, and pressed back his hair.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” said he, “that’s chap’s gone.
These foreign fellows bore me stiff. The only
way to get rid of them is simply to shut up as
you saw I did. Thank Heaven!” sighed George
again, with so much emotion that if it hadn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
been ridiculous Fanny might have imagined that
he had been as frightened of the manager as she.
As it was she felt a rush of love for George. His
hands were on the table, brown, large hands that
she knew so well. She longed to take one of them
and squeeze it hard. But, to her astonishment,
George did just that thing, leaning across the
table, put his hand over hers, and said, without
looking at her, “Fanny, darling Fanny.”</p>

<p>“Oh, George!” It was in that heavenly moment
that Fanny heard a <i>twing-twing-tootle-tootle</i>,
and a light strumming. There’s going to be music,
she thought, but the music didn’t matter
just then. Nothing mattered except love.
Faintly smiling she gazed into that faintly smiling
face, and the feeling was so blissful that she
felt inclined to say to George, “Let us stay here—where
we are—at this little table. It’s perfect,
and the sea is perfect. Let us stay.” But instead
her eyes grew serious.</p>

<p>“Darling,” said Fanny. “I want to ask you
something fearfully important. Promise me
you’ll answer. Promise.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said George, too solemn to be
quite as serious as she.</p>

<p>“It’s this.” Fanny paused a moment, looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
down, looked up again. “Do you feel,” she
said, softly, “that you really know me now? But
really, really know <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>It was too much for George. Know his
Fanny? He gave a broad, childish grin. “I
should jolly well think I do,” he said, emphatically.
“Why, what’s up?”</p>

<p>Fanny felt he hadn’t quite understood. She
went on quickly: “What I mean is this. So
often people, even when they love each other,
don’t seem to—to—it’s so hard to say—know
each other perfectly. They don’t seem to want
to. And I think that’s awful. They misunderstand
each other about the most important things
of all.” Fanny looked horrified. “George, we
couldn’t do that, could we? We never could.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be done,” laughed George, and he
was just going to tell her how much he liked her
little nose, when the waiter arrived with the tea
and the band struck up. It was a flute, a guitar,
and a violin, and it played so gaily that Fanny
felt if she wasn’t careful even the cups and saucers
might grow little wings and fly away.
George absorbed three chocolate éclairs, Fanny
two. The funny-tasting tea—“Lobster in the
kettle,” shouted George above the music—was
nice all the same, and when the tray was pushed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
aside and George was smoking, Fanny felt bold
enough to look at the other people. But it was
the band grouped under one of the dark trees that
fascinated her most. The fat man stroking the
guitar was like a picture. The dark man playing
the flute kept raising his eyebrows as though he
was astonished at the sounds that came from it.
The fiddler was in shadow.</p>

<p>The music stopped as suddenly as it had begun.
It was then she noticed a tall old man
with white hair standing beside the musicians.
Strange she hadn’t noticed him before. He
wore a very high, glazed collar, a coat green
at the seams, and shamefully shabby button
boots. Was he another manager? He did not
look like a manager, and yet he stood there gazing
over the table as though thinking of something
different and far away from all this.
Who could he be?</p>

<p>Presently, as Fanny watched him, he touched
the points of his collar with his fingers, coughed
slightly, and half-turned to the band. It began
to play again. Something boisterous, reckless,
full of fire, full of passion, was tossed into the
air, was tossed to that quiet figure, which clasped
its hands, and still with that far-away look, began
to sing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“Good Lord!” said George. It seemed that
everybody was equally astonished. Even the little
children eating ices stared, with their spoons
in the air.... Nothing was heard except a
thin, faint voice, the memory of a voice, singing
something in Spanish. It wavered, beat on,
touched the high notes, fell again, seemed to implore,
to entreat, to beg for something, and then
the tune changed, and it was resigned, it bowed
down, it knew it was denied.</p>

<p>Almost before the end a little child gave a
squeak of laughter, but everybody was smiling—except
Fanny and George. Is life like this too?
thought Fanny. There are people like this.
There is suffering. And she looked at that gorgeous
sea, lapping the land as though it loved
it, and the sky, bright with the brightness before
evening. Had she and George the right to be
so happy? Wasn’t it cruel? There must be
something else in life which made all these things
possible. What was it? She turned to George.</p>

<p>But George had been feeling differently from
Fanny. The poor old boy’s voice was funny in
a way, but, God, how it made you realize what
a terrific thing it was to be at the beginning of
everything, as they were, he and Fanny! George,
too, gazed at the bright, breathing water, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
lips opened as if he could drink it. How fine
it was! There was nothing like the sea for making
a chap feel fit. And there sat Fanny, his Fanny,
leaning forward, breathing so gently.</p>

<p>“Fanny!” George called to her.</p>

<p>As she turned to him something in her soft,
wondering look made George feel that for two
pins he would jump over the table and carry her
off.</p>

<p>“I say,” said George, rapidly, “let’s go, shall
we? Let’s go back to the hotel. Come. Do,
Fanny darling. Let’s go now.”</p>

<p>The band began to play. “Oh, God!” almost
groaned George. “Let’s go before the old codger
begins squawking again.”</p>

<p>And a moment later they were gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_CUP_OF_TEA">A CUP OF TEA</h2>

</div>

<p>Rosemary Fell was not exactly
beautiful. No, you couldn’t have called
her beautiful. Pretty? Well, if you
took her to pieces.... But why be so cruel as
to take anyone to pieces? She was young, brilliant,
extremely modern, exquisitely well dressed,
amazingly well read in the newest of the new
books, and her parties were the most delicious
mixture of the really important people and ...
artists—quaint creatures, discoveries of hers,
some of them too terrifying for words, but others
quite presentable and amusing.</p>

<p>Rosemary had been married two years. She
had a duck of a boy. No, not Peter—Michael.
And her husband absolutely adored her. They
were rich, really rich, not just comfortably well
off, which is odious and stuffy and sounds like
one’s grandparents. But if Rosemary wanted to
shop she would go to Paris as you and I would go
to Bond Street. If she wanted to buy flowers,
the car pulled up at that perfect shop in Regent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Street, and Rosemary inside the shop just gazed
in her dazzled, rather exotic way, and said:
“I want those and those and those. Give me
four bunches of those. And that jar of roses.
Yes, I’ll have all the roses in the jar. No, no
lilac. I hate lilac. It’s got no shape.” The
attendant bowed and put the lilac out of sight, as
though this was only too true; lilac was dreadfully
shapeless. “Give me those stumpy little tulips.
Those red and white ones.” And she was followed
to the car by a thin shopgirl staggering
under an immense white paper armful that looked
like a baby in long clothes....</p>

<p>One winter afternoon she had been buying
something in a little antique shop in Curzon
Street. It was a shop she liked. For one thing,
one usually had it to oneself. And then the man
who kept it was ridiculously fond of serving her.
He beamed whenever she came in. He clasped
his hands; he was so gratified he could scarcely
speak. Flattery, of course. All the same,
there was something....</p>

<p>“You see, madam,” he would explain in his
low respectful tones, “I love my things. I would
rather not part with them than sell them to someone
who does not appreciate them, who has not
that fine feeling which is so rare....” And,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
breathing deeply he unrolled a tiny square of
blue velvet and pressed it on the glass counter
with his pale finger-tips.</p>

<p>Today it was a little box. He had been
keeping it for her. He had shown it to nobody
as yet. An exquisite little enamel box with a
glaze so fine it looked as though it had been baked
in cream. On the lid a minute creature stood
under a flowery tree, and a more minute creature
still had her arms around his neck. Her hat,
really no bigger than a geranium petal, hung
from a branch; it had green ribbons. And there
was a pink cloud like a watchful cherub floating
above their heads. Rosemary took her hands
out of her long gloves. She always took off her
gloves to examine such things. Yes, she liked
it very much. She loved it; it was a great duck.
She must have it. And, turning the creamy box,
opening and shutting it, she couldn’t help noticing
how charming her hands were against the blue
velvet. The shopman, in some dim cavern of his
mind, may have dared to think so too. For he
took a pencil, leant over the counter, and his pale
bloodless fingers crept timidly towards those rosy,
flashing ones, as he murmured gently: “If I
may venture to point out to madam, the flowers on
the little lady’s bodice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Charming!” Rosemary admired the flowers.
But what was the price? For a moment the
shopman did not seem to hear. Then a murmur
reached her. “Twenty-eight guineas, madame.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight guineas.” Rosemary gave no
sign. She laid the little box down; she buttoned
her gloves again. Twenty-eight guineas. Even
if one is rich.... She looked vague. She
stared at a plump tea-kettle like a plump hen
above the shopman’s head, and her voice was
dreamy as she answered: “Well, keep it for
me—will you? I’ll....”</p>

<p>But the shopman had already bowed as though
keeping it for her was all any human being could
ask. He would be willing, of course, to keep it
for her for ever.</p>

<p>The discreet door shut with a click. She was
outside on the step, gazing at the winter afternoon.
Rain was falling, and with the rain it
seemed the dark came too, spinning down like
ashes. There was a cold bitter taste in the air,
and the new-lighted lamps looked sad. Sad were
the lights in the houses opposite. Dimly they
burned as if regretting something. And people
hurried by, hidden under their hateful umbrellas.
Rosemary felt a strange pang. She pressed her
muff to her breast; she wished she had the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
box, too, to cling to. Of course, the car was
there. She’d only to cross the pavement. But
still she waited. There are moments, horrible
moments in life, when one emerges from shelter
and looks out, and it’s awful. One oughtn’t to
give way to them. One ought to go home and
have an extra-special tea. But at the very
instant of thinking that, a young girl, thin, dark,
shadowy—where had she come from?—was
standing at Rosemary’s elbow and a voice like a
sigh, almost like a sob, breathed: “Madame,
may I speak to you a moment?”</p>

<p>“Speak to me?” Rosemary turned. She saw a
little battered creature with enormous eyes, someone
quite young, no older than herself, who
clutched at her coat-collar with reddened hands,
and shivered as though she had just come out of
the water.</p>

<p>“M-madame,” stammered the voice. “Would
you let me have the price of a cup of tea?”</p>

<p>“A cup of tea?” There was something simple,
sincere in that voice; it wasn’t in the least the
voice of a beggar. “Then have you no money
at all?” asked Rosemary.</p>

<p>“None, madam,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“How extraordinary!” Rosemary peered
through the dusk, and the girl gazed back at her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
How more than extraordinary! And suddenly
it seemed to Rosemary such an adventure. It
was like something out of a novel by Dostoevsky,
this meeting in the dusk. Supposing she took
the girl home? Supposing she did do one of
those things she was always reading about or
seeing on the stage, what would happen? It
would be thrilling. And she heard herself saying
afterwards to the amazement of her friends:
“I simply took her home with me,” as she stepped
forward and said to that dim person beside her:
“Come home to tea with me.”</p>

<p>The girl drew back startled. She even
stopped shivering for a moment. Rosemary put
out a hand and touched her arm. “I mean it,”
she said, smiling. And she felt how simple and
kind her smile was. “Why won’t you? Do.
Come home with me now in my car and have tea.”</p>

<p>“You—you don’t mean it, madam,” said the
girl, and there was pain in her voice.</p>

<p>“But I do,” cried Rosemary. “I want you to.
To please me. Come along.”</p>

<p>The girl put her fingers to her lips and her
eyes devoured Rosemary. “You’re—you’re not
taking me to the police station?” she stammered.</p>

<p>“The police station!” Rosemary laughed out.
“Why should I be so cruel? No, I only want to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
make you warm and to hear—anything you care
to tell me.”</p>

<p>Hungry people are easily led. The footman
held the door of the car open, and a moment
later they were skimming through the dusk.</p>

<p>“There!” said Rosemary. She had a feeling
of triumph as she slipped her hand through the
velvet strap. She could have said, “Now I’ve
got you,” as she gazed at the little captive she had
netted. But of course she meant it kindly. Oh,
more than kindly. She was going to prove to
this girl that—wonderful things did happen in
life, that—fairy godmothers were real, that—rich
people had hearts, and that women <em>were</em>
sisters. She turned impulsively, saying: “Don’t
be frightened. After all, why shouldn’t you
come back with me? We’re both women. If
I’m the more fortunate, you ought to expect....”</p>

<p>But happily at that moment, for she didn’t
know how the sentence was going to end, the car
stopped. The bell was rung, the door opened,
and with a charming, protecting, almost embracing
movement, Rosemary drew the other
into the hall. Warmth, softness, light, a sweet
scent, all those things so familiar to her she
never even thought about them, she watched that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
other receive. It was fascinating. She was like
the little rich girl in her nursery with all the cupboards
to open, all the boxes to unpack.</p>

<p>“Come, come upstairs,” said Rosemary, longing
to begin to be generous. “Come up to my
room.” And, besides, she wanted to spare this
poor little thing from being stared at by the
servants; she decided as they mounted the stairs
she would not even ring for Jeanne, but take off
her things by herself. The great thing was to
be natural!</p>

<p>And “There!” cried Rosemary again, as they
reached her beautiful big bedroom with the curtains
drawn, the fire leaping on her wonderful
lacquer furniture, her gold cushions and the primrose
and blue rugs.</p>

<p>The girl stood just inside the door; she
seemed dazed. But Rosemary didn’t mind that.</p>

<p>“Come and sit down,” she cried, dragging
her big chair up to the fire, “in this comfy chair.
Come and get warm. You look so dreadfully
cold.”</p>

<p>“I daren’t, madam,” said the girl, and she
edged backwards.</p>

<p>“Oh, please,”—Rosemary ran forward—“you
mustn’t be frightened, you mustn’t, really. Sit
down, and when I’ve taken off my things we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
go into the next room and have tea and be cosy.
Why are you afraid?” And gently she half
pushed the thin figure into its deep cradle.</p>

<p>But there was no answer. The girl stayed
just as she had been put, with her hands by her
sides and her mouth slightly open. To be quite
sincere, she looked rather stupid. But Rosemary
wouldn’t acknowledge it. She leant over
her, saying: “Won’t you take off your hat?
Your pretty hair is all wet. And one is so much
more comfortable without a hat, isn’t one?”</p>

<p>There was a whisper that sounded like “Very
good, madam,” and the crushed hat was taken off.</p>

<p>“Let me help you off with your coat, too,”
said Rosemary.</p>

<p>The girl stood up. But she held on to the
chair with one hand and let Rosemary pull. It
was quite an effort. The other scarcely helped
her at all. She seemed to stagger like a child,
and the thought came and went through Rosemary’s
mind, that if people wanted helping they
must respond a little, just a little, otherwise it
became very difficult indeed. And what was she
to do with the coat now? She left it on the floor,
and the hat too. She was just going to take a
cigarette off the mantelpiece when the girl said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
quickly, but so lightly and strangely: “I’m very
sorry, madam, but I’m going to faint. I shall go
off, madam, if I don’t have something.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, how thoughtless I am!” Rosemary
rushed to the bell.</p>

<p>“Tea! Tea at once! And some brandy
immediately!”</p>

<p>The maid was gone again, but the girl almost
cried out. “No, I don’t want no brandy. I
never drink brandy. It’s a cup of tea I want,
madam.” And she burst into tears.</p>

<p>It was a terrible and fascinating moment.
Rosemary knelt beside her chair.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, poor little thing,” she said.
“Don’t cry.” And she gave the other her lace
handkerchief. She really was touched beyond
words. She put her arm round those thin, bird-like
shoulders.</p>

<p>Now at last the other forgot to be shy, forgot
everything except that they were both women,
and gasped out: “I can’t go on no longer like
this. I can’t bear it. I shall do away with myself.
I can’t bear no more.”</p>

<p>“You shan’t have to. I’ll look after you.
Don’t cry any more. Don’t you see what a good
thing it was that you met me? We’ll have tea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and you’ll tell me everything. And I shall arrange
something. I promise. <em>Do</em> stop crying.
It’s so exhausting. Please!”</p>

<p>The other did stop just in time for Rosemary
to get up before the tea came. She had the table
placed between them. She plied the poor little
creature with everything, all the sandwiches, all
the bread and butter, and every time her cup was
empty she filled it with tea, cream and sugar.
People always said sugar was so nourishing. As
for herself she didn’t eat; she smoked and looked
away tactfully so that the other should not be
shy.</p>

<p>And really the effect of that slight meal was
marvellous. When the tea-table was carried
away a new being, a light, frail creature with
tangled hair, dark lips, deep, lighted eyes, lay
back in the big chair in a kind of sweet langour,
looking at the blaze. Rosemary lit a fresh
cigarette; it was time to begin.</p>

<p>“And when did you have your last meal?”
she asked softly.</p>

<p>But at that moment the door-handle turned.</p>

<p>“Rosemary, may I come in?” It was Philip.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>He came in. “Oh, I’m so sorry,” he said,
and stopped and stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“It’s quite all right,” said Rosemary smiling.
“This is my friend, Miss——”</p>

<p>“Smith, madam,” said the languid figure, who
was strangely still and unafraid.</p>

<p>“Smith,” said Rosemary. “We are going to
have a little talk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Philip. “Quite,” and his eye
caught sight of the coat and hat on the floor. He
came over to the fire and turned his back to it.
“It’s a beastly afternoon,” he said curiously,
still looking at that listless figure, looking at its
hands and boots, and then at Rosemary again.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it?” said Rosemary enthusiastically.
“Vile.”</p>

<p>Philip smiled his charming smile. “As a
matter of fact,” said he, “I wanted you to come
into the library for a moment. Would you?
Will Miss Smith excuse us?”</p>

<p>The big eyes were raised to him, but Rosemary
answered for her. “Of course she will.” And
they went out of the room together.</p>

<p>“I say,” said Philip, when they were alone.
“Explain. Who is she? What does it all
mean?”</p>

<p>Rosemary, laughing, leaned against the door
and said: “I picked her up in Curzon Street.
Really. She’s a real pick-up. She asked me for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the price of a cup of tea, and I brought her home
with me.”</p>

<p>“But what on earth are you going to do with
her?” cried Philip.</p>

<p>“Be nice to her,” said Rosemary quickly. “Be
frightfully nice to her. Look after her. I don’t
know how. We haven’t talked yet. But show
her—treat her—make her feel——”</p>

<p>“My darling girl,” said Philip, “you’re quite
mad, you know. It simply can’t be done.”</p>

<p>“I knew you’d say that,” retorted Rosemary.
“Why not? I want to. Isn’t that a reason?
And besides, one’s always reading about these
things. I decided——”</p>

<p>“But,” said Philip slowly, and he cut the end
of a cigar, “she’s so astonishingly pretty.”</p>

<p>“Pretty?” Rosemary was so surprised that
she blushed. “Do you think so? I—I hadn’t
thought about it.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” Philip struck a match.
“She’s absolutely lovely. Look again, my child.
I was bowled over when I came into your room
just now. However ... I think you’re making
a ghastly mistake. Sorry, darling, if I’m crude
and all that. But let me know if Miss Smith is
going to dine with us in time for me to look up
<cite>The Milliner’s Gazette</cite>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“You absurd creature!” said Rosemary, and
she went out of the library, but not back to her
bedroom. She went to her writing-room and
sat down at her desk. Pretty! Absolutely
lovely! Bowled over! Her heart beat like a
heavy bell. Pretty! Lovely! She drew her
cheque book towards her. But no, cheques
would be no use, of course. She opened a
drawer and took out five pound notes, looked
at them, put two back, and holding the three
squeezed in her hand, she went back to her bedroom.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Philip was still in the
library, when Rosemary came in.</p>

<p>“I only wanted to tell you,” said she, and she
leaned against the door again and looked at him
with her dazzled exotic gaze, “Miss Smith won’t
dine with us tonight.”</p>

<p>Philip put down the paper. “Oh, what’s
happened? Previous engagement?”</p>

<p>Rosemary came over and sat down on his
knee. “She insisted on going,” said she, “so I
gave the poor little thing a present of money.
I couldn’t keep her against her will, could I?”
she added softly.</p>

<p>Rosemary had just done her hair, darkened
her eyes a little, and put on her pearls. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
put up her hands and touched Philip’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“Do you like me?” said she, and her tone,
sweet, husky, troubled him.</p>

<p>“I like you awfully,” he said, and he held her
tighter. “Kiss me.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>Then Rosemary said dreamily, “I saw a
fascinating little box today. It cost twenty-eight
guineas. May I have it?”</p>

<p>Philip jumped her on his knee. “You may,
little wasteful one,” said he.</p>

<p>But that was not really what Rosemary
wanted to say.</p>

<p>“Philip,” she whispered, and she pressed his
head against her bosom, “am I <em>pretty</em>?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TAKING_THE_VEIL">TAKING THE VEIL</h2>

</div>

<p>It seemed impossible that anyone should be
unhappy on such a beautiful morning. Nobody
was, decided Edna, except herself.
The windows were flung wide in the houses.
From within there came the sound of pianos,
little hands chased after each other and ran away
from each other, practising scales. The trees
fluttered in the sunny gardens, all bright with
spring flowers. Street boys whistled, a little dog
barked; people passed by, walking so lightly, so
swiftly, they looked as though they wanted to
break into a run. Now she actually saw in the
distance a parasol, peach-coloured, the first parasol
of the year.</p>

<p>Perhaps even Edna did not look quite as unhappy
as she felt. It is not easy to look tragic
at eighteen, when you are extremely pretty, with
the cheeks and lips and shining eyes of perfect
health. Above all, when you are wearing a
French blue frock and your new spring hat
trimmed with cornflowers. True, she carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
under her arm a book bound in horrid black
leather. Perhaps the book provided a gloomy
note, but only by accident; it was the ordinary
Library binding. For Edna had made going to
the Library an excuse for getting out of the
house to think, to realise what had happened, to
decide somehow what was to be done now.</p>

<p>An awful thing had happened. Quite suddenly,
at the theatre last night, when she and
Jimmy were seated side by side in the dress-circle,
without a moment’s warning—in fact, she
had just finished a chocolate almond and passed
the box to him again—she had fallen in love with
an actor. But—fallen—in—love....</p>

<p>The feeling was unlike anything she had ever
imagined before. It wasn’t in the least pleasant.
It was hardly thrilling. Unless you can call the
most dreadful sensation of hopeless misery, despair,
agony and wretchedness, thrilling. Combined
with the certainty that if that actor met
her on the pavement after, while Jimmy was
fetching their cab, she would follow him to the
ends of the earth, at a nod, at a sign, without
giving another thought to Jimmy or her father
and mother or her happy home and countless
friends again....</p>

<p>The play had begun fairly cheerfully. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
was at the chocolate almond stage. Then the
hero had gone blind. Terrible moment! Edna
had cried so much she had to borrow Jimmy’s
folded, smooth-feeling handkerchief as well.
Not that crying mattered. Whole rows were in
tears. Even the men blew their noses with a
loud trumpeting noise and tried to peer at the
program instead of looking at the stage.
Jimmy, most mercifully dry-eyed—for what
would she have done without his handkerchief?—squeezed
her free hand, and whispered “Cheer
up, darling girl!” And it was then she had
taken a last chocolate almond to please him and
passed the box again. Then, there had been
that ghastly scene with the hero alone on the
stage in a deserted room at twilight, with a band
playing outside and the sound of cheering coming
from the street. He had tried—ah! how
painfully, how pitifully—to grope his way to the
window. He had succeeded at last. There he
stood holding the curtain while one beam of
light, just one beam, shone full on his raised
sightless face, and the band faded away into the
distance....</p>

<p>It was—really, it was absolutely—oh, the most—it
was simply—in fact, from that moment Edna
knew that life could never be the same. She drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
her hand away from Jimmy’s, leaned back, and
shut the chocolate box for ever. This at last was
love!</p>

<p>Edna and Jimmy were engaged. She had had
her hair up for a year and a half; they had been
publicly engaged for a year. But they had known
they were going to marry each other ever since
they walked in the Botanical Gardens with their
nurses, and sat on the grass with a wine biscuit
and a piece of barley-sugar each for their tea.
It was so much an accepted thing that Edna had
worn a wonderfully good imitation of an engagement-ring
out of a cracker all the time she was at
school. And up till now they had been devoted
to each other.</p>

<p>But now it was over. It was so completely
over that Edna found it difficult to believe that
Jimmy did not realize it too. She smiled wisely,
sadly, as she turned into the gardens of the Convent
of the Sacred Heart and mounted the path
that led through them to Hill Street. How
much better to know it now than to wait until
after they were married! Now it was possible
that Jimmy would get over it. No, it was no use
deceiving herself; he would never get over it!
His life was wrecked, was ruined; that was inevitable.
But he was young.... Time, people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
said, Time might make a little, just a little difference.
In forty years when he was an old man,
he might be able to think of her calmly—perhaps.
But she,—what did the future hold for her?</p>

<p>Edna had reached the top of the path. There
under a new-leafed tree, hung with little bunches
of white flowers, she sat down on a green bench
and looked over the Convent flower-beds. In
the one nearest to her there grew tender stocks,
with a border of blue, shell-like pansies, with at
one corner a clump of creamy freezias, their light
spears of green criss-crossed over the flowers.
The Convent pigeons were tumbling high in the
air, and she could hear the voice of Sister Agnes
who was giving a singing lesson. <i>Ah-me</i>, sounded
the deep tones of the nun, and <i>Ah-me</i>, they were
echoed....</p>

<p>If she did not marry Jimmy, of course she
would marry nobody. The man she was in love
with, the famous actor—Edna had far too much
common-sense not to realize that would never be.
It was very odd. She didn’t even want it to be.
Her love was too intense for that. It had to be
endured, silently; it had to torment her. It was,
she supposed, simply that kind of love.</p>

<p>“But, Edna!” cried Jimmy. “Can you never
change? Can I never hope again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Oh, what sorrow to have to say it, but it must
be said. “No, Jimmy, I will never change.”</p>

<p>Edna bowed her head; and a little flower fell
on her lap, and the voice of Sister Agnes cried
suddenly <i>Ah-no</i>, and the echo came, <i>Ah-no</i>....</p>

<p>At that moment the future was revealed.
Edna saw it all. She was astonished; it took
her breath away at first. But, after all, what
could be more natural? She would go into a convent....
Her father and mother do everything
to dissuade her, in vain. As for Jimmy,
his state of mind hardly bears thinking about.
Why can’t they understand? How can they add
to her suffering like this? The world is cruel,
terribly cruel! After a last scene when she gives
away her jewellery and so on to her best friends—she
so calm, they so broken-hearted—into a convent
she goes. No, one moment. The very
evening of her going is the actor’s last evening at
Port Willin. He receives by a strange messenger
a box. It is full of white flowers. But there is
no name, no card. Nothing? Yes, under the
roses, wrapped in a white handkerchief, Edna’s
last photograph with, written underneath,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The world forgetting, by the world forgot.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Edna sat very still under the trees; she clasped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the black book in her fingers as though it were her
missal. She takes the name of Sister Angela.
Snip! Snip! All her lovely hair is cut off. Will
she be allowed to send one curl to Jimmy? It is
contrived somehow. And in a blue gown with a
white head-band Sister Angela goes from the convent
to the chapel, from the chapel to the convent
with something unearthly in her look, in her sorrowful
eyes, and in the gentle smile with which
they greet the little children who run to her. A
saint! She hears it whispered as she paces the
chill, wax-smelling corridors. A saint! And
visitors to the chapel are told of the nun whose
voice is heard above the other voices, of her youth,
her beauty, of her tragic, tragic love. “There
is a man in this town whose life is ruined....”</p>

<p>A big bee, a golden furry fellow, crept into a
freezia, and the delicate flower leaned over,
swung, shook; and when the bee flew away it
fluttered still as though it were laughing.
Happy, careless flower!</p>

<p>Sister Angela looked at it and said, “Now it
is winter.” One night, lying in her icy cell she
hears a cry. Some stray animal is out there in
the garden, a kitten or a lamb or—well, whatever
little animal might be there. Up rises the
sleepless nun. All in white, shivering but fearless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
she goes and brings it in. But next morning,
when the bell rings for matins, she is found
tossing in high fever ... in delirium ... and
she never recovers. In three days all is over.
The service has been said in the chapel, and she
is buried in the corner of the cemetery reserved
for the nuns, where there are plain little crosses
of wood. Rest in Peace, Sister Angela....</p>

<p>Now it is evening. Two old people leaning
on each other come slowly to the grave and kneel
down sobbing, “Our daughter! Our only daughter!”
Now there comes another. He is all in
black; he comes slowly. But when he is there
and lifts his black hat, Edna sees to her horror
his hair is snow-white. Jimmy! Too late, too
late! The tears are running down his face; he
is crying <em>now</em>. Too late, too late! The wind
shakes the leafless trees in the churchyard. He
gives one awful bitter cry.</p>

<p>Edna’s black book fell with a thud to the garden
path. She jumped up, her heart beating.
My darling! No, it’s not too late. It’s all been
a mistake, a terrible dream. Oh, that white
hair! How could she have done it? She has not
done it. Oh, heavens! Oh, what happiness!
She is free, young, and nobody knows her secret.
Everything is still possible for her and Jimmy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
The house they have planned may still be built,
the little solemn boy with his hands behind his
back watching them plant the standard roses may
still be born. His baby sister.... But when
Edna got as far as his baby sister, she stretched
out her arms as though the little love came flying
through the air to her, and gazing at the garden,
at the white sprays on the tree, at those darling
pigeons blue against the blue, and the Convent
with its narrow windows, she realized that now
at last for the first time in her life—she had never
imagined any feeling like it before—she knew
what it was to be in love, but—in—love!</p>

</div>

<p>“Y’are very snug in here,” piped old
Mr. Woodifield, and he peered out
of the great, green leather armchair
by his friend the boss’s desk as a baby peers out
of its pram. His talk was over; it was time for
him to be off. But he did not want to go. Since
he had retired, since his ... stroke, the wife
and the girls kept him boxed up in the house
every day of the week except Tuesday. On Tuesday
he was dressed up and brushed and allowed
to cut back to the City for the day. Though
what he did there the wife and girls couldn’t
imagine. Made a nuisance of himself to his
friends, they supposed.... Well, perhaps so.
All the same, we cling to our last pleasures as
the tree clings to its last leaves. So there sat old
Woodifield, smoking a cigar and staring almost
greedily at the boss, who rolled in his office chair,
stout, rosy, five years older than he, and still going
strong, still at the helm. It did one good to
see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>Wistfully, admiringly, the old voice added, “It’s
snug in here, upon my word!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s comfortable enough,” agreed the
boss, and he flipped the <cite>Financial Times</cite> with a
paper-knife. As a matter of fact he was proud
of his room; he liked to have it admired, especially
by old Woodifield. It gave him a feeling
of deep, solid satisfaction to be planted there in
the midst of it in full view of that frail old figure
in the muffler.</p>

<p>“I’ve had it done up lately,” he explained, as
he had explained for the past—how many?—weeks.
“New carpet,” and he pointed to the
bright red carpet with a pattern of large white
rings. “New furniture,” and he nodded towards
the massive bookcase and the table with legs like
twisted treacle. “Electric heating!” He waved
almost exultantly towards the five transparent,
pearly sausages glowing so softly in the tilted
copper pan.</p>

<p>But he did not draw old Woodifield’s attention
to the photograph over the table of a grave-looking
boy in uniform standing in one of those
spectral photographers’ parks with photographers’
storm-clouds behind him. It was not
new. It had been there for over six years.</p>

<p>“There was something I wanted to tell you,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
said old Woodifield, and his eyes grew dim remembering.
“Now what was it? I had it in
my mind when I started out this morning.” His
hands began to tremble, and patches of red
showed above his beard.</p>

<p>Poor old chap, he’s on his last pins, thought
the boss. And, feeling kindly, he winked at
the old man, and said jokingly, “I tell you what.
I’ve got a little drop of something here that’ll do
you good before you go out into the cold again.
It’s beautiful stuff. It wouldn’t hurt a child.”
He took a key off his watch-chain, unlocked a
cupboard below his desk, and drew forth a dark,
squat bottle. “That’s the medicine,” said he.
“And the man from whom I got it told me on the
strict Q.T. it came from the cellars at Windsor
Cassel.”</p>

<p>Old Woodifield’s mouth fell open at the sight.
He couldn’t have looked more surprised if the
boss had produced a rabbit.</p>

<p>“It’s whisky, ain’t it?” he piped, feebly.</p>

<p>The boss turned the bottle and lovingly showed
him the label. Whisky it was.</p>

<p>“D’you know,” said he, peering up at the
boss wonderingly, “they won’t let me touch it
at home.” And he looked as though he was
going to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, that’s where we know a bit more than
the ladies,” cried the boss, swooping across for
two tumblers that stood on the table with the
water-bottle, and pouring a generous finger into
each. “Drink it down. It’ll do you good.
And don’t put any water with it. It’s sacrilege to
tamper with stuff like this. Ah!” He tossed
off his, pulled out his handkerchief, hastily wiped
his moustaches, and cocked an eye at old Woodifield,
who was rolling his in his chaps.</p>

<p>The old man swallowed, was silent a moment,
and then said faintly, “It’s nutty!”</p>

<p>But it warmed him; it crept into his chill old
brain—he remembered.</p>

<p>“That was it,” he said, heaving himself out
of his chair. “I thought you’d like to know.
The girls were in Belgium last week having a look
at poor Reggie’s grave, and they happened to
come across your boy’s. They’re quite near each
other, it seems.”</p>

<p>Old Woodifield paused, but the boss made no
reply. Only a quiver in his eyelids showed that
he heard.</p>

<p>“The girls were delighted with the way the
place is kept,” piped the old voice. “Beautifully
looked after. Couldn’t be better if they were
at home. You’ve not been across, have yer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“No, no!” For various reasons the boss had
not been across.</p>

<p>“There’s miles of it,” quavered old Woodifield,
“and it’s all as neat as a garden. Flowers
growing on all the graves. Nice broad paths.”
It was plain from his voice how much he liked a
nice broad path.</p>

<p>The pause came again. Then the old man
brightened wonderfully.</p>

<p>“D’you know what the hotel made the girls
pay for a pot of jam?” he piped. “Ten francs!
Robbery, I call it. It was a little pot, so Gertrude
says, no bigger than a half-crown. And
she hadn’t taken more than a spoonful when they
charged her ten francs. Gertrude brought the
pot away with her to teach ’em a lesson. Quite
right, too; it’s trading on our feelings. They
think because we’re over there having a look
around we’re ready to pay anything. That’s
what it is.” And he turned towards the door.</p>

<p>“Quite right, quite right!” cried the boss,
though what was quite right he hadn’t the least
idea. He came round by his desk, followed the
shuffling footsteps to the door, and saw the old
fellow out. Woodifield was gone.</p>

<p>For a long moment the boss stayed, staring at
nothing, while the grey-haired office messenger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
watching him, dodged in and out of his cubby-hole
like a dog that expects to be taken for a run.
Then: “I’ll see nobody for half an hour,
Macey,” said the boss. “Understand? Nobody
at all.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>The door shut, the firm heavy steps recrossed
the bright carpet, the fat body plumped down in
the spring chair, and leaning forward, the boss
covered his face with his hands. He wanted, he
intended, he had arranged to weep....</p>

<p>It had been a terrible shock to him when old
Woodifield sprang that remark upon him about
the boy’s grave. It was exactly as though the
earth had opened and he had seen the boy lying
there with Woodifield’s girls staring down at
him. For it was strange. Although over six
years had passed away, the boss never thought of
the boy except as lying unchanged, unblemished
in his uniform, asleep for ever. “My son!”
groaned the boss. But no tears came yet. In
the past, in the first months and even years after
the boy’s death, he had only to say those words to
be overcome by such grief that nothing short of
a violent fit of weeping could relieve him. Time,
he had declared then, he had told everybody,
could make no difference. Other men perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
might recover, might live their loss down, but not
he. How was it possible? His boy was an only
son. Ever since his birth the boss had worked at
building up this business for him; it had no other
meaning if it was not for the boy. Life itself
had come to have no other meaning. How on
earth could he have slaved, denied himself, kept
going all those years without the promise for ever
before him of the boy’s stepping into his shoes
and carrying on where he left off?</p>

<p>And that promise had been so near being fulfilled.
The boy had been in the office learning
the ropes for a year before the war. Every
morning they had started off together; they had
come back by the same train. And what congratulations
he had received as the boy’s father!
No wonder; he had taken to it marvellously. As
to his popularity with the staff, every man jack
of them down to old Macey couldn’t make
enough of the boy. And he wasn’t in the least
spoilt. No, he was just his bright, natural self,
with the right word for everybody, with that
boyish look and his habit of saying, “Simply
splendid!”</p>

<p>But all that was over and done with as though
it never had been. The day had come when
Macey had handed him the telegram that brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the whole place crashing about his head.
“Deeply regret to inform you....” And he
had left the office a broken man, with his life in
ruins.</p>

<p>Six years ago, six years.... How quickly
time passed! It might have happened yesterday.
The boss took his hands from his face;
he was puzzled. Something seemed to be wrong
with him. He wasn’t feeling as he wanted to
feel. He decided to get up and have a look at the
boy’s photograph. But it wasn’t a favorite
photograph of his; the expression was unnatural.
It was cold, even stern-looking. The boy had
never looked like that.</p>

<p>At that moment the boss noticed that a fly had
fallen into his broad inkpot, and was trying feebly
but desperately to clamber out again. Help!
help! said those struggling legs. But the sides of
the inkpot were wet and slippery; it fell back
again and began to swim. The boss took up a
pen, picked the fly out of the ink, and shook it
on to a piece of blotting-paper. For a fraction
of a second it lay still on the dark patch that
oozed round it. Then the front legs waved, took
hold, and, pulling its small sodden body up it
began the immense task of cleaning the ink from
its wings. Over and under, over and under, went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
a leg along a wing, as the stone goes over and
under the scythe. Then there was a pause, while
the fly, seeming to stand on the tips of its toes,
tried to expand first one wing and then the other.
It succeeded at last, and, sitting down, it began,
like a minute cat, to clean its face. Now one
could imagine that the little front legs rubbed
against each other lightly, joyfully. The horrible
danger was over; it had escaped; it was
ready for life again.</p>

<p>But just then the boss had an idea. He
plunged his pen back into the ink, leaned his thick
wrist on the blotting paper, and as the fly tried
its wings down came a great heavy blot. What
would it make of that? What indeed! The
little beggar seemed absolutely cowed, stunned,
and afraid to move because of what would happen
next. But then, as if painfully, it dragged
itself forward. The front legs waved, caught
hold, and, more slowly this time, the task began
from the beginning.</p>

<p>He’s a plucky little devil, thought the boss,
and he felt a real admiration for the fly’s courage.
That was the way to tackle things; that was the
right spirit. Never say die; it was only a question
of.... But the fly had again finished its
laborious task, and the boss had just time to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
refill his pen, to shake fair and square on the
new-cleaned body yet another dark drop. What
about it this time? A painful moment of
suspense followed. But behold, the front legs
were again waving; the boss felt a rush of relief.
He leaned over the fly and said to it tenderly,
“You artful little b....” And he actually had
the brilliant notion of breathing on it to help the
drying process. All the same, there was something
timid and weak about its efforts now, and
the boss decided that this time should be the last,
as he dipped the pen into the inkpot.</p>

<p>It was. The last blot on the soaked blotting-paper,
and the draggled fly lay in it and did not
stir. The back legs were stuck to the body; the
front legs were not to be seen.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the boss. “Look sharp!”
And he stirred it with his pen—in vain. Nothing
happened or was likely to happen. The fly
was dead.</p>

<p>The boss lifted the corpse on the end of the
paper-knife and flung it into the waste-paper
basket. But such a grinding feeling of wretchedness
seized him that he felt positively frightened.
He started forward and pressed the bell for
Macey.</p>

<p>“Bring me some fresh blotting-paper,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
sternly, “and look sharp about it.” And while
the old dog padded away he fell to wondering
what it was he had been thinking about before.
What was it? It was.... He took out his
handkerchief and passed it inside his collar. For
the life of him he could not remember.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CANARY">THE CANARY</h2>

</div>

<p>... You see that big nail to the right of
the front door? I can scarcely
look at it even now and yet I could
not bear to take it out. I should like to think it
was there always even after my time. I sometimes
hear the next people saying, “There must
have been a cage hanging from there.” And it
comforts me; I feel he is not quite forgotten.</p>

<p>... You cannot imagine how wonderfully
he sang. It was not like the singing of other
canaries. And that isn’t just my fancy. Often,
from the window, I used to see people stop at
the gate to listen, or they would lean over the
fence by the mock-orange for quite a long time—carried
away. I suppose it sounds absurd to
you—it wouldn’t if you had heard him—but it
really seemed to me that he sang whole songs
with a beginning and an end to them.</p>

<p>For instance, when I’d finished the house in
the afternoon, and changed my blouse and
brought my sewing on to the veranda here, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
used to hop, hop, hop from one perch to another,
tap against the bars as if to attract my attention,
sip a little water just as a professional singer
might, and then break into a song so exquisite that
I had to put my needle down to listen to him.
I can’t describe it; I wish I could. But it was
always the same, every afternoon, and I felt that
I understood every note of it.</p>

<p>... I loved him. How I loved him! Perhaps
it does not matter so very much what it
is one loves in this world. But love something
one must. Of course there was always my little
house and the garden, but for some reason they
were never enough. Flowers respond wonderfully,
but they don’t sympathize. Then I loved
the evening star. Does that sound foolish? I
used to go into the backyard, after sunset, and
wait for it until it shone above the dark gum
tree. I used to whisper “There you are, my
darling.” And just in that first moment it
seemed to be shining for me alone. It seemed
to understand this ... something which is like
longing, and yet it is not longing. Or regret—it
is more like regret. And yet regret for what?
I have much to be thankful for.</p>

<p>... But after he came into my life I forgot
the evening star; I did not need it any more.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
But it was strange. When the Chinaman who
came to the door with birds to sell held him
up in his tiny cage, and instead of fluttering,
fluttering, like the poor little goldfinches, he
gave a faint, small chirp, I found myself saying,
just as I had said to the star over the gum tree,
“There you are, my darling.” From that moment
he was mine.</p>

<p>... It surprises me even now to remember
how he and I shared each other’s lives. The
moment I came down in the morning and took
the cloth off his cage he greeted me with a drowsy
little note. I knew it meant “Missus! Missus!”
Then I hung him on the nail outside while I got
my three young men their breakfasts, and I
never brought him in until we had the house to
ourselves again. Then, when the washing-up
was done, it was quite a little entertainment. I
spread a newspaper over a corner of the table and
when I put the cage on it he used to beat with his
wings despairingly, as if he didn’t know what was
coming. “You’re a regular little actor,” I used
to scold him. I scraped the tray, dusted it with
fresh sand, filled his seed and water tins, tucked
a piece of chickweed and half a chili between the
bars. And I am perfectly certain he understood
and appreciated every item of this little performance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
You see by nature he was exquisitely
neat. There was never a speck on his perch.
And you’d only to see him enjoy his bath to
realize he had a real small passion for cleanliness.
His bath was put in last. And the moment it
was in he positively leapt into it. First he fluttered
one wing, then the other, then he ducked
his head and dabbled his breast feathers. Drops
of water were scattered all over the kitchen, but
still he would not get out. I used to say to him,
“Now that’s quite enough. You’re only showing
off.” And at last out he hopped and, standing
on one leg, he began to peck himself dry. Finally
he gave a shake, a flick, a twitter and he lifted
his throat—Oh, I can hardly bear to recall it.
I was always cleaning the knives at the time.
And it almost seemed to me the knives sang too,
as I rubbed them bright on the board.</p>

<p>... Company, you see—that was what he
was. Perfect company. If you have lived
alone you will realize how precious that is. Of
course there were my three young men who came
in to supper every evening, and sometimes stayed
in the dining-room afterwards reading the paper.
But I could not expect them to be interested in
the little things that made my day. Why should
they be? I was nothing to them. In fact, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
overheard them one evening talking about me on
the stairs as “the Scarecrow.” No matter. It
doesn’t matter. Not in the least. I quite
understand. They are young. Why should I
mind? But I remember feeling so especially
thankful that I was not quite alone that evening.
I told him, after they had gone out. I said “Do
you know what they call Missus?” And he put
his head on one side and looked at me with his
little bright eye until I could not help laughing.
It seemed to amuse him.</p>

<p>... Have you kept birds? If you haven’t all
this must sound, perhaps, exaggerated. People
have the idea that birds are heartless, cold little
creatures, not like dogs or cats. My washerwoman
used to say on Mondays when she wondered
why I didn’t keep “a nice fox terrier,”
“There’s no comfort, Miss, in a canary.” Untrue.
Dreadfully untrue. I remember one night.
I had had a very awful dream—dreams can be
dreadfully cruel—even after I had woken up I
could not get over it. So I put on my dressing-gown
and went down to the kitchen for a glass
of water. It was a winter night and raining hard.
I suppose I was still half asleep, but through the
kitchen window, that hadn’t a blind, it seemed to
me the dark was staring in, spying. And suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
I felt it was unbearable that I had no one
to whom I could say “I’ve had such a dreadful
dream,” or—or “Hide me from the dark.” I
even covered my face for a minute. And then
there came a little “Sweet! Sweet!” His cage
was on the table, and the cloth had slipped so that
a chink of light shone through. “Sweet!
Sweet!” said the darling little fellow again, softly,
as much as to say, “I’m here, Missus! I’m here!”
That was so beautifully comforting that I nearly
cried.</p>

<p>... And now he’s gone. I shall never have
another bird, another pet of any kind. How
could I? When I found him, lying on his back,
with his eye dim and his claws wrung, when I
realised that never again should I hear my darling
sing, something seemed to die in me. My heart
felt hollow, as if it was his cage. I shall get over
it. Of course. I must. One can get over anything
in time. And people always say I have a
cheerful disposition. They are quite right. I
thank my God I have.</p>

<p>... All the same, without being morbid, and
giving way to—to memories and so on, I must
confess that there does seem to me something
sad in life. It is hard to say what it is. I don’t
mean the sorrow that we all know, like illness and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
poverty and death. No, it is something different.
It is there, deep down, deep down, part of one,
like one’s breathing. However hard I work and
tire myself I have only to stop to know it is there,
waiting. I often wonder if everybody feels the
same. One can never know. But isn’t it extraordinary
that under his sweet, joyful little
singing it was just this sadness—ah, what is it?—that
I heard?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_MARRIED_MANS_STORY">A MARRIED MAN’S STORY</h2>

</div>

<p>It is evening. Supper is over. We have left
the small, cold dining-room, we have come
back to the sitting-room where there is a fire.
All is as usual. I am sitting at my writing table
which is placed across a corner so that I am behind
it, as it were, and facing the room. The
lamp with the green shade is alight; I have before
me two large books of reference, both open, a pile
of papers ... all the paraphernalia, in fact, of
an extremely occupied man. My wife, with her
little boy on her lap, is in a low chair before the
fire. She is about to put him to bed before she
clears away the dishes and piles them up in the
kitchen for the servant girl to-morrow morning.
But the warmth, the quiet, and the sleepy baby,
have made her dreamy. One of his red woollen
boots is off, one is on. She sits, bent forward,
clasping the little bare foot, staring into the glow,
and as the fire quickens, falls, flares again, her
shadow—an immense <cite>Mother and Child</cite>—is here
and gone again upon the wall....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>Outside it is raining. I like to think of that
cold drenched window behind the blind, and beyond,
the dark bushes in the garden, their broad
leaves bright with rain, and beyond the fence,
the gleaming road with the two hoarse little gutters
singing against each other, and the wavering
reflections of the lamps, like fishes’ tails. While
I am here, I am there, lifting my face to the dim
sky, and it seems to me it must be raining all over
the world—that the whole earth is drenched, is
sounding with a soft quick patter or hard steady
drumming, or gurgling and something that is like
sobbing and laughing mingled together, and that
light playful splashing that is of water falling into
still lakes and flowing rivers. And all at one
and the same moment I am arriving in a strange
city, slipping under the hood of the cab while the
driver whips the cover off the breathing horse,
running from shelter to shelter, dodging someone,
swerving by someone else. I am conscious
of tall houses, their doors and shutters sealed
against the night, of dripping balconies and sodden
flower-pots. I am brushing through deserted
gardens and falling into moist smelling
summer-houses (you know how soft and almost
crumbling the wood of a summer-house is in the
rain), I am standing on the dark quayside, giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
my ticket into the wet red hand of the old sailor
in an oilskin. How strong the sea smells! How
loudly the tied-up boats knock against one another!
I am crossing the wet stackyard, hooded
in an old sack, carrying a lantern, while the house-dog,
like a soaking doormat, springs, shakes himself
over me. And now I am walking along a deserted
road—it is impossible to miss the puddles,
and the trees are stirring—stirring.</p>

<p>But one could go on with such a catalogue for
ever—on and on—until one lifted the single arum
lily leaf and discovered the tiny snails clinging,
until one counted ... and what then? Aren’t
those just the signs, the traces of my feeling?
The bright green streaks made by someone who
walks over the dewy grass? Not the feeling itself.
And as I think that, a mournful glorious
voice begins to sing in my bosom. Yes, perhaps
that is nearer what I mean. What a voice!
What power! What velvety softness! Marvellous!</p>

<p>Suddenly my wife turns round quickly. She
knows—how long has she known?—that I am
not “working.” It is strange that with her full,
open gaze, she should smile so timidly—and that
she should say in such a hesitating voice, “What
are you thinking?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>I smile and draw two fingers across my forehead
in the way I have. “Nothing,” I answer
softly.</p>

<p>At that she stirs, and still trying not to make
it sound important, she says, “Oh, but you must
have been thinking of something!”</p>

<p>Then I really meet her gaze, meet it fully, and
I fancy her face quivers. Will she never grow
accustomed to these simple—one might say—everyday
little lies? Will she never learn not to
expose herself—or to build up defences?</p>

<p>“Truly, I was thinking of nothing.”</p>

<p>There! I seem to see it dart at her. She
turns away, pulls the other red sock off the baby,
sits him up, and begins to unbutton him behind.
I wonder if that little soft rolling bundle sees
anything, feels anything? Now she turns him
over on her knee, and in this light, his soft arms
and legs waving, he is extraordinarily like a young
crab. A queer thing is I can’t connect him with
my wife and myself; I’ve never accepted him as
ours. Each time when I come into the hall and
see the perambulator, I catch myself thinking:
“H’m, someone has brought a baby!” Or, when
his crying wakes me at night, I feel inclined to
blame my wife for having brought the baby in
from outside. The truth is, that though one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
might suspect her of strong maternal feelings, my
wife doesn’t seem to me the type of woman who
bears children in her own body. There’s an immense
difference! Where is that ... animal
ease and playfulness, that quick kissing and cuddling
one has been taught to expect of young
mothers? She hasn’t a sign of it. I believe that
when she ties its bonnet she feels like an aunt and
not a mother. But of course I may be wrong; she
may be passionately devoted ... I don’t think
so. At any rate, isn’t it a trifle indecent to feel
like this about one’s own wife? Indecent or not,
one has these feelings. And one other thing.
How can I reasonably expect my wife, <em>a broken-hearted
woman</em>, to spend her time tossing the
baby? But that is beside the mark. She
never even began to toss when her heart was
whole.</p>

<p>And now she has carried the baby to bed. I
hear her soft, deliberate steps moving between
the dining-room and the kitchen, there and back
again, to the tune of the clattering dishes. And
now all is quiet. What is happening now? Oh,
I know just as surely as if I’d gone to see—she
is standing in the middle of the kitchen facing the
rainy window. Her head is bent, with one finger
she is tracing something—nothing—on the table.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
It is cold in the kitchen; the gas jumps; the tap
drips; it’s a forlorn picture. And nobody is going
to come behind her, to take her in his arms, to
kiss her soft hair, to lead her to the fire and to
rub her hands warm again. Nobody is going to
call her or to wonder what she is doing out there.
And she knows it. And yet, being a woman, deep
down, deep down, she really does expect the
miracle to happen; she really could embrace that
dark, dark deceit, rather than live—like this.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>To live like this.... I write those words,
very carefully, very beautifully. For some reason
I feel inclined to sign them, or to write underneath—Trying
a New Pen. But seriously,
isn’t it staggering to think what may be contained
in one innocent-looking little phrase? It tempts
me—it tempts me terribly. Scene. The supper-table.
My wife has just handed me my tea. I
stir it, lift the spoon, idly chase and then carefully
capture a speck of tea-leaf, and having brought it
ashore, I murmur, quite gently, “How long shall
we continue to live—like—this?” And immediately
there is that famous “blinding flash and
deafening roar. Huge pieces of débris (I must
say I like débris) are flung into the air ... and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
when the dark clouds of smoke have drifted
away....” But this will never happen; I shall
never know it. It will be found upon me “intact”
as they say. “Open my heart and you will
see....”</p>

<p>Why? Ah, there you have me! There is
the most difficult question of all to answer.
Why do people stay together? Putting aside
“for the sake of the children,” and “the habit of
years” and “economic reasons” as lawyers’ nonsense—it’s
not much more—if one really does
try to find out why it is that people don’t leave
each other, one discovers a mystery. It is because
they can’t; they are bound. And nobody
on earth knows what are the bonds that bind
them except those two. Am I being obscure?
Well, the thing itself isn’t so frightfully crystal
clear, is it? Let me put it like this. Supposing
you are taken, absolutely, first into his confidence
and then into hers. Supposing you know all
there is to know about the situation. And having
given it not only your deepest sympathy but
your most honest impartial criticism, you declare,
very calmly, (but not without the slightest suggestion
of relish—for there is—I swear there is—in
the very best of us—something that leaps
up and cries “A-ahh!” for joy at the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
destroying), “Well, my opinion is that you two
people ought to part. You’ll do no earthly good
together. Indeed, it seems to me, it’s the duty
of either to set the other free.” What happens
then? He—and she—agree. It is their conviction
too. You are only saying what they have
been thinking all last night. And away they go
to act on your advice, immediately.... And
the next time you hear of them they are still together.
You see—you’ve reckoned without the
unknown quantity—which is their secret relation
to each other—and that they can’t disclose even
if they want to. Thus far you may tell and no
further. Oh, don’t misunderstand me! It need
not necessarily have anything to do with their
sleeping together.... But this brings me to
a thought I’ve often half entertained. Which is
that human beings, as we know them, don’t choose
each other at all. It is the owner, the second
self inhabiting them, who makes the choice for
his own particular purposes, and—this may sound
absurdly far-fetched—it’s the second self in the
other which responds. Dimly—dimly—or so it
has seemed to me—we realize this, at any rate
to the extent that we realize the hopelessness of
trying to escape. So that, what it all amounts to
is—if the impermanent selves of my wife and me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
are happy—<i lang="fr">tant mieux pour nous</i>—if miserable—<i lang="fr">tant
pis</i>.... But I don’t know, I don’t
know. And it may be that it’s something entirely
individual in me—this sensation (yes, it is
even a sensation) of how extraordinarily <em>shell-like</em>
we are as we are—little creatures, peering
out of the sentry-box at the gate, ogling through
our glass case at the entry, wan little servants,
who never can say for certain, even, if the master
is out or in....</p>

<p>The door opens.... My wife. She says,
“I am going to bed.”</p>

<p>And I look up vaguely, and vaguely say, “You
are going to bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” A tiny pause. “Don’t forget—will
you?—to turn out the gas in the hall.”</p>

<p>And again I repeat, “The gas in the hall.”</p>

<p>There was a time—the time before—when this
habit of mine—it really has become a habit now—it
wasn’t one then—was one of our sweetest jokes
together. It began, of course, when on several
occasions I really was deeply engaged and I didn’t
hear. I emerged only to see her shaking her head
and laughing at me, “You haven’t heard a word!”</p>

<p>“No. What did you say?”</p>

<p>Why should she think that so funny and charming?
She did; it delighted her. “Oh, my darling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
it’s so like you! It’s so—so—” And I knew
she loved me for it. I knew she positively looked
forward to coming in and disturbing me, and so—as
one does—I played up. I was guaranteed to
be wrapped away every evening at 10.30 p.m.
But now? For some reason I feel it would be
crude to stop my performance. It’s simplest to
play on. But what is she waiting for to-night?
Why doesn’t she go? Why prolong this? She
is going. No, her hand on the door-knob, she
turns round again, and she says in the most curious,
small, breathless voice, “You’re not cold?”</p>

<p>Oh, it’s not fair to be as pathetic as that!
That was simply damnable. I shuddered all over
before I managed to bring out a slow “No-o!”
while my left hand ruffles the reference pages.</p>

<p>She is gone; she will not come back again to-night.
It is not only I who recognize that; the
room changes too. It relaxes, like an old actor.
Slowly the mask is rubbed off; the look of strained
attention changes to an air of heavy sullen brooding.
Every line, every fold breathes fatigue.
The mirror is quenched; the ash whitens; only my
sly lamp burns on.... But what a cynical indifference
to me it all shows! Or should I perhaps
be flattered? No, we understand each
other. You know those stories of little children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
who are suckled by wolves and accepted by the
tribe, and how for ever after they move freely
among their fleet, grey brothers? Something like
that has happened to me. But wait! That
about the wolves won’t do. Curious! Before
I wrote it down, while it was still in my head, I
was delighted with it. It seemed to express, and
more, to suggest, just what I wanted to say.
But written, I can smell the falseness immediately
and the ... source of the smell is in that word
fleet. Don’t you agree? Fleet, grey brothers!
“Fleet.” A word I never use. When I wrote
“wolves” it skimmed across my mind like a
shadow and I couldn’t resist it. Tell me! Tell
me! Why is it so difficult to write simply—and
not only simply but <i lang="it">sotto voce</i>, if you know what
I mean? That is how I long to write. No fine
effects—no bravura. But just the plain truth,
as only a liar can tell it.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>I light a cigarette, lean back, inhale deeply—and
find myself wondering if my wife is asleep.
Or is she lying in her cold bed, staring into the
dark, with those trustful, bewildered eyes? Her
eyes are like the eyes of a cow that is being
driven along a road. “Why am I being driven—what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
harm have I done?” But I really am not
responsible for that look; it’s her natural expression.
One day, when she was turning out a cupboard,
she found a little old photograph of herself,
taken when she was a girl at school. In her
confirmation dress, she explained. And there
were the eyes, even then. I remember saying to
her, “Did you always look so sad?” Leaning
over my shoulder, she laughed lightly, “Do I look
sad? I think it’s just ... me.” And she
waited for me to say something about it. But I
was marvelling at her courage at having shown it
to me at all. It was a hideous photograph!
And I wondered again if she realized how plain
she was, and comforted herself with the idea that
people who loved each other didn’t criticize but
accepted everything, or if she really rather liked
her appearance and expected me to say something
complimentary.</p>

<p>Oh, that was base of me! How could I have
forgotten all the numberless times when I have
known her to turn away to avoid the light, press
her face into my shoulders. And, above all, how
could I have forgotten the afternoon of our wedding
day when we sat on the green bench in the
Botanical Gardens and listened to the band, how,
in an interval between two pieces, she suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
turned to me and said in the voice in which one
says, “Do you think the grass is damp?” or “Do
you think it’s time for tea?” ... “Tell me, do
you think physical beauty is so very important?”
I don’t like to think how often she had rehearsed
that question. And do you know what I answered?
At that moment, as if at my command
there came a great gush of hard, bright sound
from the band, and I managed to shout above it
cheerfully, “I didn’t hear what you said.” Devilish!
Wasn’t it? Perhaps not wholly. She
looked like the poor patient who hears the surgeon
say, “It will certainly be necessary to perform
the operation—but not now!”</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>But all this conveys the impression that my
wife and I were never really happy together.
Not true! Not true! We were marvellously,
radiantly happy. We were a model couple. If
you had seen us together, any time, any place, if
you had followed us, tracked us down, spied,
taken us off our guard, you still would have been
forced to confess, “I have never seen a more
ideally suited pair.” Until last autumn.</p>

<p>But really to explain what happened then I
should have to go back and back, I should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
to dwindle until my two hands clutched the banisters,
the stair-rail was higher than my head,
and I peered through to watch my father padding
softly up and down. There were coloured windows
on the landings. As he came up, first his
bald head was scarlet; then it was yellow. How
frightened I was! And when they put me to
bed, it was to dream that we were living inside
one of my father’s big coloured bottles. For he
was a chemist. I was born nine years after my
parents were married. I was an only child, and
the effect to produce even me—small, withered
bud I must have been—sapped all my mother’s
strength. She never left the room again. Bed,
sofa, window, she moved between the three.
Well I can see her, on the window days, sitting,
her cheek in her hand, staring out. Her room
looked over the street. Opposite there was a
wall plastered with advertisements for travelling
shows and circuses and so on. I stand beside her,
and we gaze at the slim lady in a red dress hitting
a dark gentleman over the head with a parasol, or
at the tiger peering through the jungle while the
clown, close by, balances a bottle on his nose, or
at a little golden-haired girl sitting on the knee of
an old black man in a broad cotton hat....
She says nothing. On sofa days there is a flannel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
dressing gown that I loathe, and a cushion that
keeps on slipping off the hard sofa. I pick it up.
It has flowers and writing sewn on. I ask what
the writing says, and she whispers, “Sweet Repose!”
In bed her fingers plait, in tight little
plaits, the fringe of the quilt, and her lips are
thin. And that is all there is of my mother, except
the last queer “episode” that comes later.</p>

<p>My father.... Curled up in the corner on
the lid of a round box that held sponges, I stared
at my father so long, it’s as though his image, cut
off at the waist by the counter, has remained
solid in my memory. Perfectly bald, polished
head, shaped like a thin egg, creased, creamy
cheeks, little bags under his eyes, large pale ears
like handles. His manner was discreet, sly,
faintly amused and tinged with impudence. Long
before I could appreciate it, I knew the mixture....
I even used to copy him in my corner,
bending forward, with a small reproduction of
his faint sneer. In the evening his customers
were, chiefly, young women; some of them came
in every day for his famous five-penny pick-me-up.
Their gaudy looks, their voices, their free ways,
fascinated me. I longed to be my father, handing
them across the counter the little glass of
bluish stuff they tossed off so greedily. God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
knows what it was made of. Years after I
drank some, just to see what it tasted like, and I
felt as though someone had given me a terrific
blow on the head; I felt stunned.</p>

<p>One of those evenings I remember vividly. It
was cold; it must have been autumn, for the flaring
gas was lighted after my tea. I sat in my corner
and my father was mixing something; the
shop was empty. Suddenly the bell jangled and
a young woman rushed in, crying so loud, sobbing
so hard, that it didn’t sound real. She wore a
green cape trimmed with fur and a hat with
cherries dangling. My father came from behind
the screen. But she didn’t stop herself at first.
She stood in the middle of the shop and wrung
her hands and moaned; I’ve never heard such crying
since. Presently she managed to gasp out,
“Give me a pick-me-up!” Then she drew a long
breath, trembled away from him and quavered,
“I’ve had <em>bad news</em>!” And in the flaring gaslight
I saw the whole side of her face was puffed up
and purple; her lip was cut, and her eyelid looked
as though it was gummed fast over the wet eye.
My father pushed the glass across the counter,
and she took the purse out of her stocking and
paid him. But she couldn’t drink; clutching the
glass, she stared in front of her as if she could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
believe what she saw. Each time she put her
head back the tears spurted out again. Finally
she put the glass down. It was no use. Holding
the cape with one hand, she ran in the same way
out of the shop again. My father gave no sign.
But long after she had gone I crouched in my
corner, and when I think back it’s as though I felt
my whole body vibrating—“So that’s what it is
outside,” I thought. “That’s what it’s like out
there.”</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Do you remember your childhood? I am always
coming across these marvellous accounts by
writers who declare that they remember “everything.”
I certainly don’t. The dark stretches,
the blanks, are much bigger than the bright
glimpses. I seem to have spent most of my time
like a plant in a cupboard. Now and again, when
the sun shone, a careless hand thrust me out on the
window-sill, and a careless hand whipped me in
again—and that was all. But what happened
in the darkness—I wonder? Did one grow?
pale stem ... timid leaves ... white reluctant
bud. No wonder I was hated at school.
Even the masters shrank from me. I somehow
knew that my soft hesitating voice disgusted them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
I knew, too, how they turned away from my
shocked, staring eyes. I was small and thin, and
I smelled of the shop; my nickname was Gregory
Powder. School was a tin building, stuck on the
raw hillside. There were dark red streaks like
blood in the oozing clay banks of the playground.
I hide in the dark passage, where the coats hang,
and am discovered there by one of the masters.
“What are you doing there in the dark?” His
terrible voice kills me; I die before his eyes. I
am standing in a ring of thrust-out heads; some
are grinning, some look greedy, some are spitting.
And it is always cold. Big crushed-up clouds
press across the sky; the rusty water in the school
tank is frozen; the bell sounds numb. One day
they put a dead bird in my overcoat pocket. I
found it just when I reached home. Oh, what a
strange flutter there was at my heart when I drew
out that terribly soft, cold little body, with the
legs thin as pins and the claws wrung. I sat on
the back door step in the yard and put the bird
in my cap. The feathers round the neck looked
wet, and there was a tiny tuft just above the
closed eyes that stood up too. How tightly the
beak was shut! I could not see the mark where
it was divided. I stretched out one wing and
touched the soft, secret down underneath; I tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
to make the claws curl round my little finger.
But I didn’t feel sorry for it—no! I wondered.
The smoke from our kitchen chimney poured
downwards, and flakes of soot floated—soft,
light in the air. Through a big crack in the cement
yard a poor-looking plant with dull, reddish
flowers had pushed its way. I looked at the dead
bird again.... And that is the first time that
I remember singing—rather ... listening to a
silent voice inside a little cage that was me.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>But what has all this to do with my married
happiness? How can all this affect my wife and
me? Why—to tell what happened last autumn—do
I run all this way back into the Past? The
Past—what is the Past? I might say the star-shaped
flake of soot on a leaf of the poor-looking
plant, and the bird lying on the quilted lining of
my cap, and my father’s pestle and my mother’s
cushion belong to it. But that is not to say they
are any less mine than they were when I looked
upon them with my very eyes, and touched them
with these fingers. No, they are more; they are
a living part of me. Who am I, in fact, as I sit
here at this table, but my own past? If I deny
that, I am nothing. And if I were to try to divide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
my life into childhood, youth, early manhood
and so on, it would be a kind of affectation;
I should know I was doing it just because of the
pleasantly important sensation it gives one to
rule lines, and to use green ink for childhood, red
for the next stage, and purple for the period of
adolescence. For one thing I have learnt, one
thing I do believe is, Nothing Happens Suddenly.
Yes, that is my religion, I suppose.</p>

<p>My mother’s death, for instance. Is it more
distant from me today than it was then? It is
just as close, as strange, as puzzling, and in spite
of all the countless times I have recalled the circumstances,
I know no more now than I did then,
whether I dreamed them, or whether they really
occurred. It happened when I was thirteen and
I slept in a little strip of a room on what was
called the half-landing. One night I woke up
with a start to see my mother, in her night-gown,
without even the hated flannel dressing-gown,
sitting on my bed. But the strange thing which
frightened me was, she wasn’t looking at me.
Her head was bent; the short, thin tail of hair
lay between her shoulders; her hands were
pressed between her knees, and my bed shook;
she was shivering. It was the first time I had
ever seen her out of her own room. I said, or I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
think I said, “Is that you, Mother?” And as she
turned round, I saw in the moonlight how queer
she looked. Her face looked small—quite different.
She looked like one of the boys at the
school baths, who sits on a step, shivering just
like that, and wants to go in and yet is frightened.</p>

<p>“Are you awake?” she said. Her eyes
opened; I think she smiled. She leaned towards
me. “I’ve been poisoned,” she whispered.
“Your father’s poisoned me.” And she nodded.
Then, before I could say a word, she was gone;
I thought I heard the door shut. I sat quite still,
I couldn’t move, I think I expected something else
to happen. For a long time I listened for something;
there wasn’t a sound. The candle was by
my bed, but I was too frightened to stretch out
my hand for the matches. But even while I wondered
what I ought to do, even while my heart
thumped—everything became confused. I lay
down and pulled the blankets round me. I fell
asleep, and the next morning my mother was
found dead of failure of the heart.</p>

<p>Did that visit happen? Was it a dream?
Why did she come to tell me? Or why, if she
came, did she go away so quickly? And her expression—so
joyous under the frightened look—was
that real? I believed it fully the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
of the funeral, when I saw my father dressed up
for his part, hat and all. That tall hat so gleaming
black and round was like a cork covered with
black sealing-wax, and the rest of my father was
awfully like a bottle, with his face for the label—<i>Deadly
Poison</i>. It flashed into my mind as I
stood opposite him in the hall. And Deadly
Poison, or old D. P., was my private name for
him from that day.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Late, it grows late. I love the night. I love
to feel the tide of darkness rising, slowly and
slowly washing, turning over and over, lifting,
floating, all that lies strewn upon the dark beach,
all that lies hid in rocky hollows. I love, I love
this strange feeling of drifting—whither? After
my mother’s death I hated to go to bed. I used
to sit on the window-sill, folded up, and watch the
sky. It seemed to me the moon moved much
faster than the sun. And one big, bright green
star I chose for my own. My star! But I never
thought of it beckoning to me, or twinkling
merrily for my sake. Cruel, indifferent, splendid—it
burned in the airy night. No matter—it
was mine! But, growing close up against the
window, there was a creeper with small, bunched-up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
pink and purple flowers. These did know me.
These, when I touched them at night, welcomed
my fingers; the little tendrils, so weak, so delicate,
knew I would not hurt them. When the wind
moved the leaves I felt I understood their shaking.
When I came to the window, it seemed to
me the flowers said among themselves, “The boy
is here.”</p>

<p>As the months passed, there was often a light
in my father’s room below. And I heard voices
and laughter. “He’s got some woman with him,”
I thought. But it meant nothing to me. Then
the gay voice, the sound of laughter, gave me the
idea it was one of the girls who used to come to
the shop in the evenings—and gradually I began
to imagine which girl it was. It was the dark one
in the red coat and skirt, who once had given me
a penny. A merry face stooped over me—warm
breath tickled my neck—there were little beads of
black on her long lashes, and when she opened
her arms to kiss me, there came a marvellous
wave of scent! Yes, that was the one.</p>

<p>Time passed, and I forgot the moon and my
green star and my shy creeper—I came to the
window to wait for the light in my father’s window,
to listen for the laughing voice, until one
night I dozed and I dreamed she came again—again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
she drew me to her, something soft, scented,
warm and merry hung over me like a cloud.
But when I tried to see, her eyes only mocked me,
her red lips opened and she hissed, “Little sneak!
Little sneak!” But not as if she were angry,—as
if she understood, and her smile somehow was
like a rat—hateful!</p>

<p>The night after, I lighted the candle and sat
down at the table instead. By and by, as the
flame steadied, there was a small lake of liquid
wax, surrounded by a white, smooth wall. I took
a pin and made little holes in this wall and then
sealed them up faster than the wax could escape.
After a time I fancied the candle flame joined in
the game; it leapt up, quivered, wagged; it even
seemed to laugh. But while I played with the
candle and smiled and broke off the tiny white
peaks of wax that rose above the wall and floated
them on my lake, a feeling of awful dreariness
fastened on me—yes, that’s the word. It crept
up from my knees to my thighs, into my arms; I
ached all with misery. And I felt so strangely
that I couldn’t move. Something bound me
there by the table—I couldn’t even let the pin
drop that I held between my finger and thumb.
For a moment I came to a stop, as it were.</p>

<p>Then the shrivelled case of the bud split and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
fell, the plant in the cupboard came into flower.
“Who am I?” I thought. “What is all this?”
And I looked at my room, at the broken bust of
the man called Hahnemann on top of the cupboard,
at my little bed with the pillow like an envelope.
I saw it all, but not as I had seen before....
Everything lived, everything. But
that was not all. I was equally alive and—it’s
the only way I can express it—the barriers were
down between us—I had come into my own
world!</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The barriers were down. I had been all my
life a little outcast; but until that moment no
one had “accepted” me; I had lain in the cupboard—or
the cave forlorn. But now I was
taken, I was accepted, claimed. I did not consciously
turn away from the world of human
beings; I had never known it; but I from that
night did beyond words consciously turn towards
my silent brothers....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DOVES_NEST">THE DOVES’ NEST</h2>

</div>

<p>After lunch Milly and her mother were
sitting as usual on the balcony beyond
the salon, admiring for the five hundredth
time the stocks, the roses, the small,
bright grass beneath the palms, and the oranges
against a wavy line of blue, when a card was
brought them by Marie. Visitors at the Villa
Martin were very rare. True, the English
clergyman, Mr. Sandiman, had called, and he had
come a second time with his wife to tea. But an
awful thing had happened on that second occasion.
Mother had made a mistake. She had
said “More tea, Mr. Sandybags?” Oh, what
a frightful thing to have happened! How
could she have done it? Milly still flamed at
the thought. And he had evidently not forgiven
them; he’d never come again. So this
card put them both into a flutter.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Walter Prodger</i>, they read. And then
an American address, so very much abbreviated
that neither of them understood it. Walter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Prodger? But they’d never heard of him.
Mother looked from the card to Milly.</p>

<p>“Prodger, dear?” she asked mildly, as though
helping Milly to a slice of a never-before-tasted
pudding.</p>

<p>And Milly seemed to be holding her plate back
in the way she answered “I—don’t—know,
Mother.”</p>

<p>“These are the occasions,” said Mother, becoming
a little flustered, “when one does so feel
the need of our dear English servants. Now
if I could just say, ‘What is he like, Annie?’ I
should know whether to see him or not. But
he may be some common man, selling something—one
of those American inventions for peeling
things, you know, dear. Or he may even be
some kind of foreign sharper.” Mother winced
at the hard, bright little word as though she had
given herself a dig with her embroidery scissors.</p>

<p>But here Marie smiled at Milly and murmured
“C’est un très beau Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“What does she say, dear?”</p>

<p>“She says he looks very nice, Mother.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better——” began Mother.
“Where is he now I wonder.”</p>

<p>Marie answered “In the vestibule, Madame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>In the hall! Mother jumped up, seriously
alarmed. In the hall, with all those valuable
little foreign things that didn’t belong to them
scattered over the tables.</p>

<p>“Show him in, Marie. Come, Milly, come
dear. We will see him in the salon. Oh, why
isn’t Miss Anderson here?” almost wailed
Mother.</p>

<p>But Miss Anderson, Mother’s new companion,
never was on the spot when she was wanted.
She had been engaged to be a comfort, a support
to them both. Fond of travelling, a cheerful
disposition, a good packer and so on. And then,
when they had come all this way and taken the
Villa Martin and moved in, she had turned out
to be a Roman Catholic. Half her time, more
than half, was spent wearing out the knees of
her skirts in cold churches. It was really
too....</p>

<p>The door opened. A middle-aged clean-shaven,
very well dressed stranger stood bowing
before them. His bow was stately. Milly saw
it pleased Mother very much; she bowed her
Queen Alexandra bow back. As for Milly, she
never could bow. She smiled, feeling shy, but
deeply interested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“Have I the pleasure,” said the stranger very
courteously, with a strong American accent, “of
speaking with Mrs. Wyndham Fawcett?”</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Fawcett,” said Mother, graciously,
“and this is my daughter, Mildred.”</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you, Miss Fawcett.” And
the stranger shot a fresh, chill hand at Milly,
who grasped it just in time before it was gone
again.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” said Mother, and
she waved faintly at all the gilt chairs.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>Down he sat, still solemn, crossing his legs,
and, most surprisingly, his arms as well. His
face looked at them over his dark arms as over
a gate.</p>

<p>“Milly, sit down, dear.”</p>

<p>So Milly sat down, too, on the Madame
Recamier couch, and traced a filet lace flower
with her finger. There was a little pause. She
saw the stranger swallow; Mother’s fan opened
and shut.</p>

<p>Then he said “I took the liberty of calling,
Mrs. Fawcett, because had the pleasure of your
husband’s acquaintance in the States when he
was lecturing there some years ago. I should
like very much to renoo our—well—I venture to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
hope we might call it friendship. Is he with
you at present? Are you expecting him out? I
noticed his name was not mentioned in the local
paper. But I put that down to a foreign custom,
perhaps—giving precedence to the lady.”</p>

<p>And here the stranger looked as though he
might be going to smile.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact it was extremely awkward.
Mother’s mouth shook. Milly squeezed
her hands between her knees, but she watched
hard from under her eyebrows. Good, noble
little Mummy! How Milly admired her as she
heard her say, gently and quite simply, “I
am sorry to say my husband died two years
ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger gave a great start. “Did he?”
He thrust out his under lip, frowned, pondered.
“I am truly sorry to hear that, Mrs. Fawcett.
I hope you’ll believe me when I say I had no
idea your husband had ... passed over.”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Mother softly stroked her
skirt.</p>

<p>“I do trust,” said Mr. Prodger, more seriously
still, “that my inquiry didn’t give you too
much pain.”</p>

<p>“No, no. It’s quite all right,” said the gentle
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Prodger insisted. “You’re sure?
You’re positive?”</p>

<p>At that Mother raised her head and gave him
one of her still, bright, exalted glances that
Milly knew so well. “I’m not in the least hurt,”
she said, as one might say it from the midst of
the fiery furnace.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger looked relieved. He changed
his attitude and continued. “I hope this regrettable
circumstance will not deprive me of
your——”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly not. We shall be delighted.
We are always so pleased to know any one
who——” Mother gave a little bound, a little
flutter. She flew from her shadowy branch on
to a sunny one. “Is this your first visit to the
Riviera?”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Mr. Prodger. “The fact is I
was in Florence until recently. But I took a
heavy cold there——”</p>

<p>“Florence so damp,” cooed Mother.</p>

<p>“And the doctor recommended I should come
here for the sunshine before I started for home.”</p>

<p>“The sun is so very lovely here,” agreed
Mother, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think we get too much of it,”
said Mr. Prodger, dubiously, and two lines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
showed at his lips. “I seem to have been sitting
around in my hotel more days than I care
to count.”</p>

<p>“Ah, hotels are so very trying,” said Mother,
and she drooped sympathetically at the thought
of a lonely man in an hotel.... “You are
alone here?” she asked, gently, just in case ...
one never knew ... it was better to be on the
safe, the tactful side.</p>

<p>But her fears were groundless.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m alone,” cried Mr. Prodger,
more heartily than he had spoken yet, and he
took a speck of thread off his immaculate trouser
leg. Something in his voice puzzled Milly.
What was it?</p>

<p>“Still, the scenery is so very beautiful,” said
Mother, “that one really does not feel the need
of friends. I was only saying to my daughter
yesterday I could live here for years without
going outside the garden gate. It is all so
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Mr. Prodger, soberly. He
added, “You have a very charming villa.” And
he glanced round the salon. “Is all this antique
furniture genuine, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“I believe so,” said Mother. “I was certainly
given to understand it was. Yes, we love our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
villa. But of course it is very large for two,
that is to say three, ladies. My companion,
Miss Anderson, is with us. But unfortunately
she is a Roman Catholic, and so she is out most
of the time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger bowed as one who agreed that
Roman Catholics were very seldom in.</p>

<p>“But I am so fond of space,” continued
Mother, “and so is my daughter. We both love
large rooms and plenty of them—don’t we,
Milly?”</p>

<p>This time Mr. Prodger looked at Milly quite
cordially and remarked, “Yes, young people like
plenty of room to run about.”</p>

<p>He got up, put one hand behind his back,
slapped the other upon it and went over to the
balcony.</p>

<p>“You’ve a view of the sea from here,” he
observed.</p>

<p>The ladies might well have noticed it;
the whole Mediterranean swung before the
windows.</p>

<p>“We are so fond of the sea,” said Mother,
getting up, too.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger looked towards Milly. “Do
you see those yachts, Miss Fawcett?”</p>

<p>Milly saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Do you happen to know what they’re doing?”
asked Mr. Prodger.</p>

<p>What they were doing? What a funny
question! Milly stared and bit her lip.</p>

<p>“They’re racing!” said Mr. Prodger, and this
time he did actually smile at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” stammered Milly. “Of
course they are.” She knew that.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re not always at it,” said Mr.
Prodger, good-humouredly. And he turned to
Mother and began to take a ceremonious farewell.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” hesitated Mother, folding her
little hands and eyeing him, “if you would care
to lunch with us—if you would not be too dull
with two ladies. We should be so very pleased.”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger became intensely serious again.
He seemed to brace himself to meet the luncheon
invitation. “Thank you very much, Mrs. Fawcett.
I should be delighted.”</p>

<p>“That will be very nice,” said Mother, warmly.
“Let me see. Today is Monday—isn’t it,
Milly? Would Wednesday suit you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger replied, “It would suit me
excellently to lunch with you on Wednesday,
Mrs. Fawcett. At <i>mee-dee</i>, I presume, as they
call it here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no! We keep our English times. At
one o’clock,” said Mother.</p>

<p>And that being arranged, Mr. Prodger became
more and more ceremonious and bowed
himself out of the room.</p>

<p>Mother rang for Marie to look after him, and
a moment later the big glass hall-door shut.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Mother. She was all smiles.
Little smiles like butterflies, alighting on her lips
and gone again. “That was an adventure, Milly,
wasn’t it, dear? And I thought he was such a
very charming man, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Milly made a little face at Mother and rubbed
her eye.</p>

<p>“Of course you did. You must have, dear.
And his appearance was so satisfactory—wasn’t
it?” Mother was obviously enraptured. “I
mean he looked so very well kept. Did you
notice his hands? Every nail shone like a
diamond. I must say I do like to see....”</p>

<p>She broke off. She came over to Milly and
patted her big collar straight.</p>

<p>“You do think it was right of me to ask him
to lunch—don’t you, dear?” said Mother
pathetically.</p>

<p>Mother made her feel so big, so tall. But
she was tall. She could pick Mother up in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
arms. Sometimes, rare moods came when she
did. Swooped on Mother who squeaked like a
mouse and even kicked. But not lately. Very
seldom now....</p>

<p>“It was so strange,” said Mother. There
was the still, bright, exalted glance again. “I
suddenly seemed to hear Father say to me ‘Ask
him to lunch.’ And then there was some—warning....
I think it was about the wine.
But that I didn’t catch—very unfortunately,”
she added, mournfully. She put her hand on
her breast; she bowed her head. “Father is still
so near,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Milly looked out of the window. She hated
Mother going on like this. But of course she
couldn’t say anything. Out of the window there
was the sea and the sunlight silver on the palms,
like water dripping from silver oars. Milly felt
a yearning—what was it?—it was like a yearning
to fly.</p>

<p>But Mother’s voice brought her back to the
salon, to the gilt chairs, the gilt couches, sconces,
cabinets, the tables with the heavy-sweet flowers,
the faded brocade, the pink-spotted Chinese
dragons on the mantelpiece and the two Turks’
heads in the fireplace that supported the broad
logs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“I think a leg of lamb would be nice, don’t you,
dear?” said Mother. “The lamb is so very
small and delicate just now. And men like
nothing so much as plain roast meat. Yvonne
prepares it so nicely, too, with that little frill of
paper lace round the top of the leg. It always
reminds me of something—I can’t think what.
But it certainly makes it look very attractive indeed.”</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Wednesday came. And the flutter that
Mother and Milly had felt over the visiting card
extended to the whole villa. Yes, it was not
too much to say that the whole villa thrilled and
fluttered at the idea of having a man to lunch.
Old, flat-footed Yvonne came waddling back
from market with a piece of gorgonzola in so
perfect a condition that when she found Marie
in the kitchen she flung down her great basket,
snatched the morsel up and held it, rustling in
its paper, to her quivering bosom.</p>

<p>“J’ai trouvé un morceau de gorgonzola,” she
panted, rolling up her eyes as though she invited
the heavens themselves to look down upon it.
“J’ai un morceau de gorgonzola ici pour un
prince, ma fille.” And hissing the word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
“prr-ince” like lightning, she thrust the morsel
under Marie’s nose. Marie, who was a delicate
creature, almost swooned at the shock.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” cried Yvonne, scornfully,
“that I would ever buy such cheese <i lang="fr">pour ces
dames</i>? Never. Never. <i lang="fr">Jamais de ma vie.</i>”
Her sausage finger wagged before her nose, and
she minced in a dreadful imitation of Mother’s
French, “We have none of us large appetites,
Yvonne. We are very fond of boiled eggs and
mashed potatoes and a nice, plain salad. Ah-Bah!”
With a snort of contempt she flung
away her shawl, rolled up her sleeves, and began
unpacking the basket. At the bottom there was
a flat bottle which, sighing, she laid aside.</p>

<p>“De quoi pour mes cors,” said she.</p>

<p>And Marie, seizing a bottle of Sauterne and
bearing it off to the dining-room murmured, as
she shut the kitchen door behind her, “Et voilà
pour les cors de Monsieur!”</p>

<p>The dining-room was a large room panelled
in dark wood. It had a massive mantelpiece
and carved chairs covered in crimson damask.
On the heavy, polished table stood an oval glass
dish decorated with little gilt swags. This dish,
which it was Marie’s duty to keep filled with
fresh flowers, fascinated her. The sight of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
gave her a <i lang="fr">frisson</i>. It reminded her always, as
it lay solitary on the dark expanse, of a little
tomb. And one day, passing through the long
windows on to the stone terrace and down the
steps into the garden she had the happy thought
of so arranging the flowers that they would be
appropriate to one of the ladies on a future
tragic occasion. Her first creation had been
terrible. <cite>Tomb of Mademoiselle Anderson</cite> in
black pansies, lily-of-the-valley, and a frill of
heliotrope. It gave her a most intense, curious
pleasure to hand Miss Anderson the potatoes at
lunch, and at the same time to gaze beyond her
at her triumph. It was like (<i lang="fr">O ciel!</i>), it was like
handing potatoes to a corpse.</p>

<p>The <cite>Tomb of Madame</cite> was on the contrary
almost gay. Foolish little flowers, half yellow,
half blue, hung over the edge, wisps of green
trailed across, and in the middle there was a
large scarlet rose. <i lang="fr">Cœur saignant</i>, Marie had
called it. But it did not look in the least like
a <i lang="fr">cœur saignant</i>. It looked flushed and cheerful,
like Mother emerging from the luxury of a warm
bath.</p>

<p>Milly’s, of course, was all white. White
stocks, little white rose-buds, with a sprig or two
of dark box edging. It was Mother’s favorite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>Poor innocent! Marie, at the sideboard, had
to turn her back when she heard Mother exclaim,
“Isn’t it pretty, Milly? Isn’t it sweetly pretty?
Most artistic. So original.” And she had said
to Marie, “C’est très joli, Marie. Très original.”</p>

<p>Marie’s smile was so remarkable that Milly,
peeling a tangerine, remarked to Mother, “I
don’t think she likes you to admire them. It
makes her uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>But today—the glory of her opportunity
made Marie feel quite faint as she seized her
flower scissors. <i lang="fr">Tombeau d’un beau Monsieur.</i>
She was forbidden to cut the orchids that grew
round the fountain basin. But what were orchids
for if not for such an occasion? Her fingers
trembled as the scissors snipped away.
They were enough; Marie added two small
sprays of palm. And back in the dining-room
she had the happy idea of binding the palm
together with a twist of gold thread deftly torn
off the fringe of the dining-room curtains. The
effect was superb. Marie almost seemed to see
her <i lang="fr">beau Monsieur</i>, very small, very small, at the
bottom of the bowl, in full evening dress with a
ribbon across his chest and his ears white as wax.</p>

<p>What surprised Milly, however, was that Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Anderson should pay any attention to Mr. Prodger’s
coming. She rustled to breakfast in her
best black silk blouse, her Sunday blouse, with
the large, painful-looking crucifix dangling over
the front. Milly was alone when Miss Anderson
entered the dining-room. This was unfortunate,
for she always tried to avoid being left
alone with Miss Anderson. She could not say
exactly why; it was a feeling. She had the feeling
that Miss Anderson might say something
about God, or something fearfully intimate.
Oh, she would sink through the floor if such a
thing happened; she would expire. Supposing
she were to say “Milly, do you believe in our
Lord?” Heavens! It simply didn’t bear thinking
about.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dear,” said Miss Anderson,
and her fingers, cold, pale, like church
candles, touched Milly’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Anderson. May I
give you some coffee?” said Milly, trying to be
natural.</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear child,” said Miss Anderson,
and laughing her light, nervous laugh, she
hooked on her eyeglasses and stared at the basket
of rolls. “And is it today that you expect your
guest?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>Now why did she ask that? Why pretend
when she knew perfectly well? That was all
part of her strangeness. Or was it because she
wanted to be friendly? Miss Anderson was
more than friendly; she was genial. But there
was always this something. Was she spying?
People said at school that Roman Catholics
spied.... Miss Anderson rustled, rustled
about the house like a dead leaf. Now she was
on the stairs, now in the upstairs passage. Sometimes,
at night, when Milly was feverish, she
woke up and heard that rustle outside her door.
Was Miss Anderson looking through the keyhole?
And one night she actually had the idea
that Miss Anderson had bored two holes in the
wall above her head and was watching her from
there. The feeling was so strong that next time
she went into Miss Anderson’s room her eyes
flew to the spot. To her horror a large picture
hung there. Had it been there before?...</p>

<p>“Guest?” The crisp breakfast roll broke in
half at the word.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it is,” said Milly, vaguely, and
her blue, flower-like eyes were raised to Miss
Anderson in a vague stare.</p>

<p>“It will make quite a little change in our
little party,” said the much-too-pleasant voice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
“I confess I miss very much the society of men.
I have had such a great deal of it in my life.
I think that ladies by themselves are apt to get
a little—h’m—h’m....” And helping herself
to cherry jam, she spilt it on the cloth.</p>

<p>Milly took a large, childish bite out of her
roll. There was nothing to reply to this. But
how young Miss Anderson made her feel! She
made her want to be naughty, to pour milk over
her head or make a noise with a spoon.</p>

<p>“Ladies by themselves,” went on Miss Anderson,
who realized none of this, “are very apt to
find their interests limited.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Milly, goaded to reply. People
always said that; it sounded most unfair.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Miss Anderson, taking off her
eyeglasses and looking a little dim, “it is the
absence of political discussion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, politics!” cried Milly, airily. “I hate
politics. Father always said——” But here
she pulled up short. She crimsoned. She didn’t
want to talk about Father to Miss Anderson.</p>

<p>“Oh! Look! Look! A butterfly!” cried
Miss Anderson, softly and hastily. “Look,
what a darling!” Her own cheeks flushed a
slow red at the sight of the darling butterfly
fluttering so softly over the glittering table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>That was very nice of Miss Anderson—fearfully
nice of her. She must have realized that
Milly didn’t want to talk about Father and so
she had mentioned the butterfly on purpose.
Milly smiled at Miss Anderson as she never had
smiled at her before. And she said in her warm,
youthful voice, “He is a duck, isn’t he? I love
butterflies. I think they are great lambs.”</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>The morning whisked away as foreign mornings
do. Mother had half decided to wear her
hat at lunch.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Milly? Do you think
as head of the house it might be appropriate?
On the other hand one does not want to do anything
at all extreme.”</p>

<p>“Which do you mean, Mother? Your mushroom
or the jampot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not the jampot, dear.” Mother was
quite used to Milly’s name for it. “I somehow
don’t feel myself in a hat without a brim. And
to tell you the truth I am still not quite certain
whether I was wise in buying the jampot. I cannot
help the feeling that if I were to meet Father
in it he would be a little too surprised. More
than once lately,” went on Mother quickly, “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
have thought of taking off the trimming, turning
in upside down, and making it into a nice little
workbag. What do you think, dear? But we
must not go into it now, Milly. This is not the
moment for such schemes. Come on to the
balcony. I have told Marie we shall have coffee
there. What about bringing out that big chair
with the nice, substantial legs for Mr. Prodger?
Men are so fond of nice, substantial.... No,
not by yourself, love! Let me help you.”</p>

<p>When the chair was carried out Milly thought
it looked exactly like Mr. Prodger. It <em>was</em> Mr.
Prodger admiring the view.</p>

<p>“No, don’t sit down on it. You mustn’t,” she
cried hastily, as Mother began to subside. She
put her arm through Mother’s and drew her back
into the salon.</p>

<p>Happily, at that moment there was a rustle
and Miss Anderson was upon them. In excellent
time, for once. She carried a copy of the <cite>Morning
Post</cite>.</p>

<p>“I have been trying to find out from this,”
said she, lightly tapping the newspaper with her
eyeglasses, “whether Congress is sitting at present.
But unfortunately, after reading my copy
right through, I happened to glance at the heading
and discovered it was five weeks’ old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>Congress! Would Mr. Prodger expect them
to talk about Congress? The idea terrified
Mother. Congress! The American parliament,
of course, composed of senators—grey-bearded
old men in frock coats and turn-down
collars, rather like missionaries. But she did
not feel at all competent to discuss them.</p>

<p>“I think we had better not be too intellectual,”
she suggested, timidly, fearful of disappointing
Miss Anderson, but more fearful still of the
alternative.</p>

<p>“Still, one likes to be prepared,” said Miss
Anderson. And after a pause she added softly,
“One never knows.”</p>

<p>Ah, how true that is! One never does. Miss
Anderson and Mother seemed both to ponder
this truth. They sat silent, with head bent, as
though listening to the whisper of the words.</p>

<p>“One never knows,” said the pink-spotted
dragons on the mantelpiece and the Turks’
heads pondered. Nothing is known—nothing.
Everybody just waits for things to happen as
they were waiting there for the stranger who
came walking towards them through the sun and
shadow under the budding plane trees, or driving,
perhaps, in one of the small, cotton-covered
cabs.... An angel passed over the Villa Martin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
In that moment of hovering silence something
beseeching seemed to lift, seemed to offer
itself, as the flowers in the salon, uplifted, gave
themselves to the light.</p>

<p>Then Mother said, “I hope Mr. Prodger will
not find the scent of the mimosa too powerful.
Men are not fond of flowers in a room as a rule.
I have heard it causes actual hay-fever in some
cases. What do you think, Milly? Ought we
perhaps——” But there was no time to do
anything. A long firm trill sounded from the
hall door. It was a trill so calm and composed
and unlike the tentative little push they gave
the bell that it brought them back to the seriousness
of the moment. They heard a man’s voice;
the door clicked and shut again. He was inside.
A stick rattled on the table. There was a pause,
and then the door handle of the salon turned and
Marie, in frilled muslin cuffs and an apron
shaped like a heart, ushered in Mr. Prodger.</p>

<p>Only Mr. Prodger after all? But whom had
Milly expected to see? The feeling was there
and gone again that she would not have been
surprised to see somebody quite different, before
she realized this wasn’t quite the same Mr.
Prodger as before. He was smarter than ever;
all brushed, combed, shining. The ears that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Marie had seen white as wax flashed as if they
had been pink enamelled. Mother fluttered up
in her pretty little way, so hoping he had not
found the heat of the day too trying to be out
in ... but happily it was a little early in the
year for dust. Then Miss Anderson was introduced.
Milly was ready this time for that fresh
hand, but she almost gasped; it was so very chill.
It was like a hand stretched out to you from
the water. Then together they all sat down.</p>

<p>“Is this your first visit to the Riviera?” asked
Miss Anderson, graciously, dropping her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“It is,” answered Mr. Prodger composedly,
and he folded his arms as before. “I was in
Florence until recently, but I caught a heavy
cold——”</p>

<p>“Florence so——” began Mother, when the
beautiful brass gong, that burned like a fallen
sun in the shadows of the hall, began to throb.
First it was a low muttering, then it swelled, it
quickened, it burst into a clash of triumph under
Marie’s sympathetic fingers. Never had they
been treated to such a performance before.
Mr. Prodger was all attention.</p>

<p>“That’s a very fine gong,” he remarked approvingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“We think it is so very Oriental,” said Mother.
“It gives our little meals quite an Eastern
flavour. Shall we....”</p>

<p>Their guest was at the door bowing.</p>

<p>“So many gentlemen and only one lady,”
fluttered Mother. “What I mean is the boot is
on the other shoe. That is to say—come, Milly,
come, dear.” And she led the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Well, there they were. The cold, fresh napkins
were shaken out of their charming shapes
and Marie handed the omelette. Mr. Prodger
sat on Mother’s right, facing Milly, and Miss
Anderson had her back to the long windows. But
after all—why should the fact of their having a
man with them make such a difference? It did;
it made all the difference. Why should they feel
so stirred at the sight of that large hand outspread,
moving among the wine glasses? Why
should the sound of that loud, confident
“Ah-hm!” change the very look of the dining-room?
It was not a favourite room of theirs as
a rule; it was overpowering. They bobbed uncertainly
at the pale table with a curious feeling
of exposure. They were like those meek guests
who arrive unexpectedly at the fashionable hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and are served with whatever may be ready, while
the real luncheon, the real guests lurk important
and contemptuous in the background. And although
it was impossible for Marie to be other
than deft, nimble and silent, what heart could she
have in ministering to that most uninspiring of
spectacles—three ladies dining alone?</p>

<p>Now all was changed. Marie filled their
glasses to the brim as if to reward them for some
marvellous feat of courage. These timid English
ladies had captured a live lion, a real one,
smelling faintly of eau de cologne, and with a tip
of handkerchief showing, white as a flake of snow.</p>

<p>“He is worthy of it,” decided Marie, eyeing
her orchids and palms.</p>

<p>Mr. Prodger touched his hot plate with appreciative
fingers.</p>

<p>“You’ll hardly believe it, Mrs. Fawcett,” he
remarked, turning to Mother, “but this is the
first hot plate I’ve happened on since I left the
States. I had begun to believe there were two
things that just weren’t to be had in Europe.
One was a hot plate and the other was a glass of
cold water. Well, the cold water one can do
without; but a hot plate is more difficult. I’d got
so discouraged with the cold wet ones I encountered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
everywhere that when I was arranging with
Cook’s Agency about my room here I explained
to them ‘I don’t care what the expense may be.
But for mercy’s sake find me an hotel where I
can get a hot plate by ringing for it.’”</p>

<p>Mother, though outwardly all sympathy, found
this a little bewildering. She had a momentary
vision of Mr. Prodger ringing for hot plates to
be brought to him at all hours. Such strange
things to want in any numbers.</p>

<p>“I have always heard the American hotels are
so very well equipped,” said Miss Anderson.
“Telephones in all the rooms and even tape
machines.”</p>

<p>Milly could see Miss Anderson reading that
tape machine.</p>

<p>“I should like to go to America awfully,” she
cried, as Marie brought in the lamb and set it
before Mother.</p>

<p>“There’s certainly nothing wrong with America,”
said Mr. Prodger, soberly. “America’s a
great country. What are they? Peas? Well,
I’ll just take a few. I don’t eat peas as a rule.
No, no salad, thank you. Not with the hot
meat.”</p>

<p>“But what makes you want to go to America?”
Miss Anderson ducked forward, smiling at Milly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
and her eyeglasses fell into her plate, just escaping
the gravy.</p>

<p>Because one wants to go everywhere, was the
real answer. But Milly’s flower-blue gaze rested
thoughtfully on Miss Anderson as she said, “The
ice-cream. I adore ice-cream.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” said Mr. Prodger, and he put down
his fork; he seemed moved. “So you’re fond of
ice-cream, are you, Miss Fawcett?”</p>

<p>Milly transferred her dazzling gaze to him.
It said she was.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Prodger quite playfully, and
he began eating again, “I’d like to see you get it.
I’m sorry we can’t manage to ship some across.
I like to see young people have just what they
want. It seems right, somehow.”</p>

<p>Kind man! Would he have any more lamb?</p>

<p>Lunch passed so pleasantly, so quickly, that the
famous piece of gorgonzola was on the table in
all its fatness and richness before there had been
an awkward moment. The truth was that Mr.
Prodger proved most easy to entertain, most
ready to chat. As a rule men were not fond of
chat as Mother understood it. They did not
seem to understand that it does not matter very
much what one says; the important thing is not
to let the conversation drop. Strange! Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the best men ignored that simple rule. They refused
to realize that conversation is like a dear
little baby that is brought in to be handed round.
You must rock it, nurse it, keep it on the move
if you want it to keep smiling. What could
be simpler? But even Father.... Mother
winced away from memories that were not as
sweet as memories ought to be.</p>

<p>All the same she could not help hoping that
Father saw what a successful little lunch party
it was. He did so love to see Milly happy, and
the child looked more animated than she had
done for weeks. She had lost that dreamy expression,
which, though very sweet, did not seem
natural at her age. Perhaps what she wanted
was not so much Easton’s Syrup as taking out of
herself.</p>

<p>“I have been very selfish,” thought Mother,
blaming herself as usual. She put her hand on
Milly’s arm; she pressed it gently as they rose
from the table. And Marie held the door open
for the white and grey figure; for Miss Anderson,
who peered shortsightedly, as though looking for
something; for Mr. Prodger who brought up the
rear, walking stately, with the benign air of a
Monsieur who had eaten well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Beyond the balcony, the garden, the palms and
the sea lay bathed in quivering brightness. Not
a leaf moved; the oranges were little worlds of
burning light. There was the sound of grasshoppers
ringing their tiny tambourines, and the
hum of bees as they hovered, as though to taste
their joy in advance, before burrowing close into
the warm wide-open stocks and roses. The sound
of the sea was like a breath, was like a sigh.</p>

<p>Did the little group on the balcony hear it?
Mother’s fingers moved among the black and
gold coffee-cups; Miss Anderson brought the most
uncomfortable chair out of the salon and sat
down. Mr. Prodger put his large hand on to the
yellow stone ledge of the balcony and remarked
gravely, “This balcony rail is just as hot as it
can be.”</p>

<p>“They say,” said Mother, “that the greatest
heat of the day is at about half-past two. We
have certainly noticed it is very hot then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s lovely then,” murmured Milly, and
she stretched out her hand to the sun. “It’s
simply baking!”</p>

<p>“Then you’re not afraid of the sunshine?” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Mr. Prodger, taking his coffee from Mother.
“No, thank you. I won’t take any cream. Just
one lump of sugar.” And he sat down balancing
the little, chattering cup on his broad knee.</p>

<p>“No, I adore it,” answered Milly, and she began
to nibble the lump of sugar....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SIX_YEARS_AFTER">SIX YEARS AFTER</h2>

</div>

<p>It was not the afternoon to be on deck—on
the contrary. It was exactly the afternoon
when there is no snugger place than a warm
cabin, a warm bunk. Tucked up with a rug, a
hot-water bottle and a piping hot cup of tea she
would not have minded the weather in the least.
But he—hated cabins, hated to be inside anywhere
more than was absolutely necessary. He
had a passion for keeping, as he called it, above
board, especially when he was travelling. And
it wasn’t surprising, considering the enormous
amount of time he spent cooped up in the office.
So, when he rushed away from her as soon as they
got on board and came back five minutes later to
say he had secured two deck chairs on the lee side
and the steward was undoing the rugs, her voice
through the high sealskin collar murmured
“Good”; and because he was looking at her, she
smiled with bright eyes and blinked quickly, as if
to say, “Yes, perfectly all right—absolutely,”
and she meant it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“Then we’d better——” said he, and he tucked
her hand inside his arm and began to rush her off
to where the two chairs stood. But she just had
time to breathe, “Not so fast, Daddy, please,”
when he remembered too and slowed down.</p>

<p>Strange! They had been married twenty-eight
years, and it was still an effort to him, each time,
to adapt his pace to hers.</p>

<p>“Not cold, are you?” he asked, glancing sideways
at her. Her little nose, geranium pink
above the dark fur, was answer enough. But
she thrust her free hand into the velvet pocket of
her jacket and murmured gaily, “I shall be glad
of my rug.”</p>

<p>He pressed her tighter to his side—a quick,
nervous pressure. He knew, of course, that she
ought to be down in the cabin; he knew that it
was no afternoon for her to be sitting on deck, in
this cold and raw mist, lee side or no lee side,
rugs or no rugs, and he realized how she must
be hating it. But he had come to believe that it
really was easier for her to make these sacrifices
than it was for him. Take their present case,
for instance. If he had gone down to the cabin
with her, he would have been miserable the whole
time, and he couldn’t have helped showing it. At
any rate, she would have found him out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
Whereas, having made up her mind to fall in with
his ideas, he would have betted anybody she
would even go so far as to enjoy the experience.
Not because she was without personality of her
own. Good Lord! She was absolutely brimming
with it. But because ... but here his
thoughts always stopped. Here they always felt
the need of a cigar, as it were. And, looking at
the cigar-tip, his fine blue eyes narrowed. It was
a law of marriage, he supposed.... All the
same, he always felt guilty when he asked these
sacrifices of her. That was what the quick pressure
meant. His being said to her being: “You
do understand, don’t you?” and there was an answering
tremor of her fingers, “I <em>understand</em>.”</p>

<p>Certainly, the steward—good little chap—had
done all in his power to make them comfortable.
He had put up their chairs in whatever warmth
there was and out of the smell. She did hope he
would be tipped adequately. It was on occasions
like these (and her life seemed to be full of such
occasions) that she wished it was the woman who
controlled the purse.</p>

<p>“Thank you, steward. That will do beautifully.”</p>

<p>“Why are stewards so often delicate-looking?”
she wondered, as her feet were tucked under.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
“This poor little chap looks as though he’d got a
chest, and yet one would have thought ... the
sea air....”</p>

<p>The button of the pigskin purse was undone.
The tray was tilted. She saw sixpences, shillings,
half-crowns.</p>

<p>“I should give him five shillings,” she decided,
“and tell him to buy himself a good nourishing——”</p>

<p>He was given a shilling, and he touched his cap
and seemed genuinely grateful.</p>

<p>Well, it might have been worse. It might
have been sixpence. It might, indeed. For at
that moment Father turned towards her and said,
half-apologetically, stuffing the purse back, “I
gave him a shilling. I think it was worth it,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite! Every bit!” said she.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how peaceful it feels on a
little steamer once the bustle of leaving port is
over. In a quarter of an hour one might have
been at sea for days. There is something almost
touching, childish, in the way people submit themselves
to the new conditions. They go to bed in
the early afternoon, they shut their eyes and “it’s
night” like little children who turn the table upside
down and cover themselves with the table-cloth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
And those who remain on deck—they
seem to be always the same, those few hardened
men travellers—pause, light their pipes, stamp
softly, gaze out to sea, and their voices are subdued
as they walk up and down. The long-legged
little girl chases after the red-cheeked boy,
but soon both are captured; and the old sailor,
swinging an unlighted lantern, passes and disappears....</p>

<p>He lay back, the rug up to his chin and she saw
he was breathing deeply. Sea air! If anyone
believed in sea air, it was he. He had the strongest
faith in its tonic qualities. But the great
thing was, according to him, to fill the lungs with
it the moment you came on board. Otherwise,
the sheer strength of it was enough to give you
a chill....</p>

<p>She gave a small chuckle, and he turned to her
quickly. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s your cap,” she said. “I never can get
used to you in a cap. You look such a thorough
burglar.”</p>

<p>“Well, what the deuce am I to wear?” He
shot up one grey eyebrow and wrinkled his nose.
“It’s a very good cap, too. Very fine specimen
of its kind. It’s got a very rich white satin lining.”
He paused. He declaimed, as he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
hundreds of times before at this stage. “Rich and
rare were the gems she wore.”</p>

<p>But she was thinking he really was childishly
proud of the white satin lining. He would like
to have taken off his cap and made her feel it.
“Feel the quality!” How often had she rubbed
between finger and thumb his coat, his shirt cuff,
tie, sock, linen handkerchief, while he said that.</p>

<p>She slipped down more deeply into her chair.</p>

<p>And the little steamer pressed on, pitching
gently, over the grey, unbroken, gently-moving
water, that was veiled with slanting rain.</p>

<p>Far out, as though idly, listlessly, gulls were
flying. Now they settled on the waves, now they
beat up into the rainy air, and shone against the
pale sky like the lights within a pearl. They
looked cold and lonely. How lonely it will be
when we have passed by, she thought. There
will be nothing but the waves and those birds and
rain falling.</p>

<p>She gazed through the rust-spotted railing
along which big drops trembled, until suddenly
she shut her lips. It was as if a warning voice
inside her had said, “Don’t look!”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” she decided. “It’s too depressing,
much too depressing.”</p>

<p>But immediately, she opened her eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
looked again. Lonely birds, water lifting, white
pale sky—how were they changed?</p>

<p>And it seemed to her there was a presence far
out there, between the sky and the water; someone
very desolate and longing watched them pass
and cried as if to stop them—but cried to her
alone.</p>

<p>“Mother!”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me,” sounded the cry. “Don’t
forget me! You are forgetting me, you know
you are!” And it was as though from her own
breast there came the sound of childish weeping.</p>

<p>“My son—my precious child—it isn’t true!”</p>

<p><em>Sh!</em> How was it possible that she was sitting
there on that quiet steamer beside Father and at
the same time she was hushing and holding a little
slender boy—so pale—who had just waked out
of a dreadful dream?</p>

<p>“I dreamed I was in a wood—somewhere far
away from everybody,—and I was lying down
and a great blackberry vine grew over me. And
I called and called to you—and you wouldn’t
come—you wouldn’t come—so I had to lie there
for ever.”</p>

<p>What a terrible dream! He had always had
terrible dreams. How often, years ago, when
he was small, she had made some excuse and escaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
from their friends in the dining-room or
the drawing-room to come to the foot of the stairs
and listen. “Mother!” And when he was
asleep, his dream had journeyed with her back
into the circle of lamplight; it had taken its place
there like a ghost. And now——</p>

<p>Far more often—at all times—in all places—like
now, for instance—she never settled down,
she was never off her guard for a moment but she
heard him. He wanted her. “I am coming as
fast as I can! As fast as I can!” But the dark
stairs have no ending, and the worst dream of all—the
one that is always the same—goes for ever
and ever uncomforted.</p>

<p>This is anguish! How is it to be borne?
Still, it is not the idea of her suffering which is
unbearable—it is his. Can one do nothing for
the dead? And for a long time the answer had
been—Nothing!</p>

<p class="tb">... But softly without a sound the dark curtain
has rolled down. There is no more to come.
That is the end of the play. But it can’t end like
that—so suddenly. There must be more. No,
it’s cold, it’s still. There is nothing to be gained
by waiting.</p>

<p>But—did he go back again? Or, when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
war was over, did he come home for good?
Surely, he will marry—later on—not for several
years. Surely, one day I shall remember his wedding
and my first grandchild—a beautiful dark-haired
boy born in the early morning—a lovely
morning—spring!</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, it’s not fair to me to put these
ideas into my head! Stop, Mother, stop! When
I think of all I have missed, I can’t bear it.”</p>

<p class="tb">“I can’t bear it!” She sits up breathing the
words and tosses the dark rug away. It is colder
than ever, and now the dusk is falling, falling like
ash upon the pallid water.</p>

<p>And the little steamer, growing determined,
throbbed on, pressed on, as if at the end of the
journey there waited....</p>

</div>

<p>I had been in Port Willin six months when
I decided to give a one-man show. Not
that I was particularly keen, but little Field,
the picture-shop man, had just started a gallery
and he wanted me—begged me, rather—to kick
off for him. He was a decent little chap; I hadn’t
the heart to refuse. And besides, as it happened,
I had a good deal of stuff that I felt it would be
rather fun to palm off on any one who was fool
enough to buy it. So with these high aims I had
the cards printed, the pictures framed in plain
white frames, and God knows how many cups and
saucers ordered for the Private View.</p>

<p>What was I doing in Port Willin? Oh well—why
not? I’ll own it does sound an unlikely
spot, but when you are an impermanent movable,
as I am, it’s just those unlikely spots that have a
trick of holding you. I arrived, intending to
stay a week and go on to Fiji. But I had letters
to one or two people, and the morning of my
arrival, hanging over the side of the ship while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
we were waiting in the stream, with nothing on
earth to do but stare, I took an extraordinary
fancy to the shape—to the look of the place.</p>

<p>It’s a small town, you know, planted at the
edge of a fine deep harbour like a lake. Behind
it, on either side there are hills. The houses are
built of light painted wood. They have iron
roofs coloured red. And there are big dark
plumy trees massed together, breaking up those
light shapes, giving a depth—warmth—making
a composition of it well worth looking at....
Well, we needn’t go into that— But it had me
that fine morning. And the first days after my
arrival, walking, or driving out in one of the big
swinging, rocking cabs, I took an equal fancy to
the people.</p>

<p>Not quite all of them. The men left me cold.
Yes, I must say, colonial men are not the brightest
specimens. But I never struck a place where the
average of female attractiveness was so high.
You can’t help noticing it, for a peculiarity of
Port Willin is the number of its teashops and the
vast quantity of tea absorbed by its inhabitants.
Not tea only—sandwiches, cream cakes, ices, fruit
salad with fresh pineapples. From eleven o’clock
in the morning you meet with couples, and groups
of girls and young married women hurrying off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
to their first tea. It was a real eleven o’clock
function. Even the business men knocked off and
went to a café. And the same thing happened
in the afternoon. From four until half-past six
the streets were gay as a garden. Which reminds
me, it was early spring when I arrived and
the town smelled of moist earth and the first
flowers. In fact, wherever one went one got a
strong whiff, like the whiff of violets in a wood,
which was enough in itself to make one feel like
lingering....</p>

<p>There was a theatre too, a big bare building
plastered over with red and blue bills which gave
it an oriental look in that blue air, and a touring
company was playing “San Toy.” I went my
first evening. I found it, for some reason, fearfully
exciting. The inside smelled of gas, of glue
and burnt paper. Whistling draughts cut along
the corridors—a strong wind among the orchestra
kept the palms trembling, and now and again the
curtain blew out and there was a glimpse of a pair
of large feet walking rapidly away. But what
women! What girls in muslin dresses with velvet
sashes and little caps edged with swansdown!
In the intervals long ripples of laughter sounded
from the stalls, from the dress-circle. And I
leaned against a pillar that looked as though it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
was made of wedding-cake icing—and fell in love
with whole rows at a time....</p>

<p>Then I presented my letters, I was asked out to
dine, and I met these charmers in their own
homes. That decided it. They were something
I had never known before—so gay, so
friendly, so impressed with the idea of one’s being
an artist! It was rather like finding oneself
in the playground of an extremely attractive girls’
school.</p>

<p>I painted the Premier’s daughter, a dark
beauty, against a tree hung with long bell-like
flowers, as white as wax. I painted a girl with
a pig-tail curled up on a white sofa playing with
a pale-red fan ... and a little blonde in a black
jacket with pearl-grey gloves.... I painted
like fury.</p>

<p>I’m fond of women. As a matter of fact I’m
a great deal more at ease with women than I am
with men. Because I’ve cultivated them, I suppose.
You see, it’s like this with me. I’ve always
had enough money to live on and the consequence
is I have never had to mix with people
more than I wished. And I’ve equally always
had—well, I suppose you might call it a passion—for
painting. Painting is far and away the
most important thing in life—as I see it. But—my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
work’s my own affair. It’s the separate compartment
which is me. No strangers allowed in.
I haven’t the smallest desire to explain what it
is I’m after—or to hear other men. If people
like my work I’m pleased. If they don’t—well,
if I was a shrugging person, I’d shrug. This
sounds arrogant. It isn’t; I know my limitations.
But the truth about oneself always sounds arrogant,
as no doubt you’ve observed.</p>

<p>But women—well, I can only speak for myself—I
find the presence of women, the consciousness
of women, an absolute necessity. I know they
are considered a distraction, that the very Big
Pots seal themselves in their hives to keep away.
All I can say is work without women would be to
me like dancing without music or food without
wine or a sailing boat without a breeze. They
just give me that ... what is it? Stimulus is
not enough; inspiration is far too much. That—well,
if I knew what it is, I should have solved
a bigger problem than my own! And problems
aren’t in my line.</p>

<p>I expected a mob at my Private View, and I
got it, too.... What I hadn’t reckoned on was
that there would be no men. It was one thing
to ask a painter fellow to knock you up something
to the tune of fifty guineas or so, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
quite another to make an ass of yourself staring.
The Port Willin men would as soon have gazed
into shops. True, when you came to Europe, you
visited the galleries, but then you shop-gazed
too. It didn’t matter what you did in Europe.
You could walk about for a week without being
recognized.</p>

<p>So there were little Field and I absolutely
alone among all that loveliness; it frightened him
out of his life, but I didn’t mind, I thought it
rather fun, especially as the sightseers didn’t hesitate
to find my pictures amusing. I’m by no
means an out-and-out modern, as they say; people
like violins and landscapes of telegraph poles
leave me cold. But Port Willin is still trying to
swallow Rossetti, and Hope by Watts is looked
upon as very advanced. It was natural my pictures
should surprise them. The fat old Lady
Mayoress became quite hysterical. She drew me
over to one drawing, she patted my arm with her
fan.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you drew her slipping out,”
she gurgled. “And how depressed she looks!
The poor dear never could have sat down in it.
It’s much too small. There ought to be a little
cake of Pear’s Soap on the floor.” And overcome
by her own joke, she flopped on the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
double bench that ran down the middle of the
room, and even her fan seemed to laugh.</p>

<p>At that moment two girls passed in front of
us. One I knew, a big fair girl called May
Pollock, pulled her companion by the sleeve.
“Daphne!” she said. “Daphne!” And the
other turned towards her, then towards us, smiled
and was born, christened part of my world from
that moment.</p>

<p>“Daphne!” Her quick beautiful smile answered....</p>

<p class="tb">Saturday morning was gloriously fine. When
I woke up and saw the sun streaming over the
polished floor I felt like a little boy who has been
promised a picnic. It was all I could do not to
telephone to Daphne. Was she feeling the same?
It seemed somehow such a terrific lark that we
should be going off together like this, just with a
couple of rucksacks and our bathing suits. I
thought of other week-ends, the preparation, the
emotional tension, the amount of managing they’d
needed. But I couldn’t really think of them; I
couldn’t be bothered, they belonged to another
life....</p>

<p class="tb">It seemed to me suddenly so preposterous that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
two people should be as happy as we were and
not be happier. Here we were, alone, miles away
from everybody, free as air, and in love with each
other. I looked again at Daphne, at her slender
shoulders, her throat, her bosom, and, passionately
in love, I decided, with fervour: Wouldn’t
it be rather absurd, then, to behave like a couple
of children? Wouldn’t she even, in spite of all
she had said, be disappointed if we did?...</p>

<p class="tb">And I went off at a tremendous pace, not because
I thought she’d run after me, but I did think
she might call, or I might look round....</p>

<p class="tb">It was one of those still, hushed days when the
sea and the sky seem to melt into one another, and
it is long before the moisture dries on the leaves
and grasses. One of those days when the sea
smells strong and there are gulls standing in a
row on the sand. The smoke from our wood fire
hung in the air and the smoke of my pipe mingled
with it. I caught myself staring at nothing. I
felt dull and angry. I couldn’t get over the
ridiculous affair. You see, my <i lang="fr">amour propre</i> was
wounded.</p>

<p class="tb">Monday morning was grey, cloudy, one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
those mornings peculiar to the sea-side when
everything, the sea most of all, seems exhausted
and sullen. There had been a very high tide,
the road was wet—on the beach there stood a
long line of sickly-looking gulls....</p>

<p>When we got on board she sat down on one
of the green benches and, muttering something
about a pipe, I walked quickly away. It was intolerable
that we should still be together after
what had happened. It was indecent. I only
asked—I only longed for one thing—to be free
of this still, unsmiling and pitiful—that was the
worst of it—creature who had been my playful
Daphne.</p>

<p class="tb">For answer I telephoned her at once and asked
if I might come and see her that evening. Her
voice sounded grave, unlike the voice I remembered,
and she seemed to deliberate. There was
a long pause before she said, “Yes—perhaps that
would be best.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall come at half-past six.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>And we went into a room full of flowers and
very large art photographs of the Harbour by
Night, A Misty Day, Moonrise over the Water,
and I know I wondered if she admired them.</p>

<p>“Why did you send me that letter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I had to,” said Daphne. “I meant
every word of it. I only let you come to-night
to.... No, I know I shall disappoint you.
I’m wiser than you are for all your experience. I
shan’t be able to live up to it. I’m not the person
for you. Really I’m not!”...</p>

</div>

<p>At midday, Ernestine, who had come down
from the mountains with her mother to
work in the vineyards belonging to the
hotel, heard the faint, far-away <i>chuff-chuff</i> of the
train from Italy. Trains were a novelty to Ernestine;
they were fascinating, unknown, terrible.
What were they like as they came tearing their
way through the valley, plunging between the
mountains as if not even the mountains could stop
them? When she saw the dark, flat breast of the
engine, so bare, so powerful, hurled as it were
towards her, she felt a weakness; she could have
sunk to the earth. And yet she must look. So
she straightened up, stopped pulling at the blue-green
leaves, tugging at the long, bright-green,
curly suckers, and, with eyes like a bird, stared.
The vines were very tall. There was nothing to
be seen of Ernestine but her beautiful, youthful
bosom buttoned into a blue cotton jacket and her
small, dark head covered with a faded cherry-coloured
handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p><i>Chiff-chuff-chaff.</i> <i>Chiff-chuff-chaff</i>, sounded the
train. Now a wisp of white smoke shone and
melted. Now there was another, and the monster
itself came into sight and snorting horribly
drew up at the little, toy-like station five minutes
away. The railway ran at the bottom of the
hotel garden which was perched high and surrounded
by a stone wall. Steps cut in the stone
led to the terraces where the vines were planted.
Ernestine, looking out from the leaves like a
bright bird, saw the terrible engine and looked beyond
it at doors swinging open, at strangers stepping
down. She would never know who they were
or where they had come from. A moment ago
they were not here; perhaps tomorrow they would
be gone again. And looking like a bird herself,
she remembered how, at home, in the late autumn,
she had sometimes seen strange birds in the fir
tree that were there one day and gone the next.
Where from? Where to? She felt an ache
in her bosom. Wings were tight-folded there.
Why could she not stretch them out and fly away
and away?...</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>From the first-class carriage tall, thin Emily
alighted and gave her hand to Father whose brittle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
legs seemed to wave in the air as they felt for
the iron step. Taller, thinner Edith followed,
carrying Father’s light overcoat, his field-glasses
on a strap, and his new Baedeker. The blond
hotel porter came forward. Wasn’t that nice?
He could speak as good English as you and me.
So Edith had no trouble at all in explaining how,
as they were going on by the morning train tomorrow,
they would only need their suit-cases, and
what was left in the compartment. Was there
a carriage outside? Yes, a carriage was there.
But if they cared to walk there was a private
entrance through the hotel gardens.... No,
they wouldn’t walk.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t care to walk, would you, Father
dear?”</p>

<p>“No, Edith, I won’t walk. Do you girls
wanna walk?”</p>

<p>“Why no, Father, not without you, dear.”</p>

<p>And the blond hotel porter leading, they passed
through the little knot of sturdy peasants at the
station gate to where the carriage waited under a
group of limes.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything as big as that horse,
Edith!” cried Emily. She was always the first
to exclaim about things.</p>

<p>“It is a very big horse,” sang Edith, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
sober. “It’s a farm horse, from the look of it
and it’s been working. See how hot it is.” Edith
had so much observation. The big, brown horse,
his sides streaked with dark sweat, tossed his
head and the bells on his collar set up a loud
jangling.</p>

<p>“Hu-yup!” called the young peasant driver
warningly, from his seat on the high box.</p>

<p>Father, who was just about to get in, drew
back, a little scared.</p>

<p>“You don’t think that horse will run away with
us, do you, Edith?” he quavered.</p>

<p>“Why no, Father dear,” coaxed Edith. “That
horse is just as tame as you or me.” So in they
got, the three of them. And as the horse
bounded forward his ears seemed to twitch in
surprise at his friend the driver. Call that a
load? Father and the girls weighed nothing.
They might have been three bones, three broomsticks,
three umbrellas bouncing up and down on
the hard seats of the carriage. It was a mercy
the hotel was so close. Father could never have
stood that for more than a minute, especially
at the end of a journey. Even as it was his
face was quite green when Emily helped him
out, straightened him, and gave him a little
pull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“It’s shaken you, dear, hasn’t it?” she said
tenderly.</p>

<p>But he refused her arm into the hotel. That
would create a wrong impression.</p>

<p>“No, no, Emily. I’m all right. All right,”
said Father, as staggering a little he followed
them through big glass doors into a hall as dim
as a church and as chill and as deserted.</p>

<p>My! Wasn’t that hall cold! The cold seemed
to come leaping at them from the floor. It
clasped the peaked knees of Edith and Emily; it
leapt high as the fluttering heart of Father. For
a moment they hesitated, drew together, almost
gasped. But then out from the Bureau a cheerful
young person, her smiling face spotted with
mosquito bites, ran to meet them, and welcomed
them with such real enthusiasm (in English too)
that the chill first moment was forgotten.</p>

<p>“Aw-yes. Aw-yes. I can let you ave very
naice rooms on de firs floor wid a lif. Two rooms
and bart and dressing-room for de chentleman.
Beautiful rooms wid sun but nort too hot. Very
naice. Till tomorrow. I taike you. If you
please. It is dis way. You are tired wid the
churney? Launch is at half-pas tvelf. Hort
worter? Aw-yes. It is wid de bart. If you
please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Father and the girls were drawn by her cheerful
smiles and becks and nods along a cloister-like
corridor, into the lift and up, until she flung
open a heavy, dark door and stood aside for them
to enter.</p>

<p>“It is a suite,” she explained. “Wid a hall and
tree doors.” Quickly she opened them. “Now
I gaw to see when your luggage is gum.”</p>

<p>And she went.</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Emily.</p>

<p>Edith stared.</p>

<p>Father craned his thin, old neck, looking, too.</p>

<p>“Did you—ever see the like, Edith?” cried
Emily, in a little rush.</p>

<p>And Edith softly clasped her hands. Softly
she sang “No, I never did, Emily. I’ve never
seen anything just like this before.”</p>

<p>“Sims to me a nice room,” quavered Father,
still hovering. “Do you girls wanna change it?”</p>

<p>Change it! “Why, Father dear, it’s just the
loveliest thing we’ve ever set eyes on, isn’t it,
Emily? Sit down, Father dear, sit down in the
armchair.”</p>

<p>Father’s pale claws gripped the velvet arms.
He lowered himself, he sank with an old man’s
quick sigh.</p>

<p>Edith still stood, as if bewitched, at the door.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
But Emily ran over to the window and leaned out,
quite girlish....</p>

<p>For a long time now—for how long?—for
countless ages—Father and the girls had been on
the wing. Nice, Montreux, Biarritz, Naples,
Mentone, Lake Maggiore, they had seen them
all and many, many more. And still they beat
on, beat on, flying as if unwearied, never stopping
anywhere for long. But the truth was—Oh, better
not enquire what the truth was. Better not
ask what it was that kept them going. Or why
the only word that daunted Father was the word—home....</p>

<p>Home! To sit around, doing nothing, listening
to the clock, counting up the years, thinking
back ... thinking! To stay fixed in one place
as if waiting for something or somebody. No!
no! Better far to be blown over the earth like
the husk, like the withered pod that the wind
carries and drops and bears off again.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, girls?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father dear.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better be off if we’re to make that
train.”</p>

<p>But oh, it was a weariness, it was an unspeakable
weariness. Father made no secret of his
age; he was eighty-four. As for Edith and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Emily—well, he looked now like their elder
brother. An old, old brother and two ancient
sisters, so the lovely room might have summed
them up. But its shaded brightness, its beauty,
the flutter of leaves at the creamy stone windows
seemed only to whisper “Rest! Stay!”</p>

<p>Edith looked at the pale, green-panelled walls,
at the doors that had lozenges and squares of
green picked out in gold. She made the amazing
discovery that the floor had the same pattern
in wood that was traced on the high, painted
ceiling. But the colour of the shining floor was
marvellous; it was like tortoiseshell. In one corner
there was a huge, tilted stove, milky white
and blue. The low wooden bed, with its cover
of quilted yellow satin, had sheaves of corn carved
on the bed posts. It looked to fanciful, tired
Edith—yes,—that bed looked as if it were breathing,
softly, gently breathing. Outside the narrow,
deep-set windows, beyond their wreaths of
green, she could see a whole, tiny landscape
bright as a jewel in the summer heat.</p>

<p>“Rest! Stay!” Was it the sound of the
leaves outside? No, it was in the air; it was the
room itself that whispered joyfully, shyly. Edith
felt so strange that she could keep quiet no longer.</p>

<p>“This is a very old room, Emily,” she warbled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
softly. “I know what it is. This hotel has
not always been a hotel. It’s been an old château.
I feel as sure of that as that I’m standing here.”
Perhaps she wanted to convince herself that she
was standing there. “Do you see that stove?”
She walked over to the stove. “It’s got figures
on it. Emily,” she warbled faintly, “It’s 1623.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that too wonderful!” cried Emily.</p>

<p>Even Father was deeply moved.</p>

<p>“1623? Nearly three hundred years old.”
And suddenly, in spite of his tiredness, he gave a
thin, airy, old man’s chuckle. “Makes yer feel
quite a chicken, don’t it?” said Father.</p>

<p>Emily’s breathless little laugh answered him;
it too was gay.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see what’s behind that door,”
she cried. And half running to the door in the
middle wall she lifted the slender steel catch.
It led into a larger room, into Edith’s and her
bedroom. But the walls were the same and the
floor, and there were the same deep-set windows.
Only two beds instead of one stood side by side
with blue silk quilts instead of yellow. And what
a beautiful old chest there was under the windows!</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Emily, in rapture. “Isn’t it all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
too perfectly historical for words, Edith! It
makes me feel——” She stopped, she looked
at Edith who had followed her and whose thin
shadow lay on the sunny floor. “Queer!” said
Emily, trying to put all she felt into that one
word. “I don’t know what it is.”</p>

<p>Perhaps if Edith, the discoverer, had had time,
she might have satisfied Emily. But a knock
sounded at the outer door; it was the luggage boy.
And while he brought in their suitcases there came
from downstairs the ringing of the luncheon bell.
Father mustn’t be kept waiting. Once a bell had
gone he liked to follow it up right then. So without
even a glance at the mirror—they had reached
the age when it is as natural to avoid mirrors as
it is to peer into them when one is young—Edith
and Emily were ready.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, girls?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father dear.”</p>

<p>And off they went again, to the left, to the
right, down a stone staircase with a broad, worn
balustrade, to the left again, finding their way
as if by instinct—Edith first, then Father, and
Emily close behind.</p>

<p>But when they reached the <i lang="fr">salle à manger</i>,
which was as big as a ball-room, it was still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
empty. All gay, all glittering, the long French
windows open on to the green and gold garden,
the <i lang="fr">salle à manger</i> stretched before them. And
the fifty little tables with the fifty pots of dahlias
looked as if they might begin dancing with....</p>

</div>

<p>At breakfast that morning they were in
wonderfully good spirits. Who was responsible—he
or she? It was true she
made a point of looking her best in the morning;
she thought it part of her duty to him—to their
love, even, to wear charming little caps, funny
little coats, coloured mules at breakfast time, and
to see that the table was perfect as he and she—fastidious
pair!—understood the word. But he,
too, so fresh, well-groomed and content, contributed
his share.... She had been down
first, sitting at her place when he came in. He
leaned over the back of her chair, his hands on
her shoulders; he bent down and lightly rubbed
his cheek against hers, murmuring gently but with
just enough pride of proprietorship to make her
flush with delight, “Give me my tea, love.” And
she lifted the silver teapot that had a silver pear
modelled on the lid and gave him his tea.</p>

<p>“Thanks.... You know you look awfully
well this morning!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Do I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do that again. Look at me again.
It’s your eyes. They’re like a child’s. I’ve
never known anyone have such shining eyes as
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” She sighed for joy. “I do love
having sweet things said to me!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do—spoilt child! Shall I give you
some of this?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.... Darling!” Her hand
flew across the table and clasped his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>But she said nothing, only “Darling!” again.
There was the look on his face she loved—a kind
of sweet jesting. He was pretending he didn’t
know what she meant, and yet of course he did
know. He was pretending to be feeling “Here
she is—trust a woman—all ready for a passionate
love scene over the breakfast table at nine o’clock
in the morning.” But she wasn’t deceived. She
knew he felt just the same as she did. That
amused tolerance, that mock despair was part of
the ways of men—no more.</p>

<p>“May I be allowed to <em>use</em> this knife please, or
to put it down?”</p>

<p>Really! Mona had never yet got accustomed
to her husband’s smile. They had been married<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
for three years. She was in love with him for
countless reasons, but apart from them all, a special
reason all to itself, was because of his smile.
If it hadn’t sounded nonsense she would have
said she fell in love at first sight over and over
again when he smiled. Other people felt the
charm of it, too. Other women, she was certain.
Sometimes she thought that even the servants
watched for it....</p>

<p>“Don’t forget we’re going to the theatre to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good egg! I had forgotten. It’s ages
since we went to a show.”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it? I feel quite thrilled.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we might have a tiny small
celebration at dinner?” (“Tiny small” was one
of her expressions. But why did it sound so
sweet when he used it?)</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s. You mean champagne?” And
she looked into the distance, and said in a far-away
voice: “Then I must revise the sweet.”</p>

<p>At that moment the maid came in with the
letters. There were four for him, three for her.
No, one of hers belonged to him, too, rather a
grimy little envelope with a dab of sealing wax
on the back.</p>

<p>“Why do you get all the letters?” she wailed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
handing it across. “It’s awfully unfair. I love
letters and I never get any.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do like that!” said he. “How can
you sit there and tell such awful bangers? It’s
the rarest thing on earth for me to get a letter in
the morning. It’s always you who get those
mysterious epistles from girls you were at college
with or faded aunts. Here, have half my pear—it’s
a beauty.” She held out her plate.</p>

<p>The Rutherfords never shared their letters.
It was her idea that they should not. He had
been violently opposed to it at first. She couldn’t
help laughing; he had so absolutely misunderstood
her reason.</p>

<p>“Good God! my dear. You’re perfectly welcome
to open any letters of mine that come to
the house—or to read any letters of mine that
may be lying about. I think I can promise
you....”</p>

<p>“Oh no, no, darling, that’s not what I mean.
I don’t suspect you.” And she put her hands
on his cheeks and kissed him quickly. He looked
like an offended boy. “But so many of Mother’s
old friends write to me—confide in me—don’t
you know?—tell me things they wouldn’t for the
world tell a man. I feel it wouldn’t be fair to
them. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>He gave way at last. But “I’m old fashioned,”
he said, and his smile was a little rueful.
“I like to feel my wife reads my letters.”</p>

<p>“My precious dear! I’ve made you unhappy.”
She felt so repentant; she didn’t know
quite about what. “Of course I’d love to
read....”</p>

<p>“No, no! That’s all right. It’s understood.
We’ll keep the bond.” And they had kept it.</p>

<p>He slit open the grimy envelope. He began
to read. “Damn!” he said and thrust out his
under lip.</p>

<p>“Why, what is it? Something horrid?”</p>

<p>“No—annoying. I shall be late this evening.
A man wants to meet me at the office at six
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Was that a business letter?” She sounded
surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, why?”</p>

<p>“It looked so awfully unbusinesslike. The
sealing-wax and the funny writing—much more
like a woman’s than a man’s.”</p>

<p>He laughed. He folded the letter, put it in
his pocket and picked up the envelope. “Yes,”
he said, “it is queer, isn’t it. I shouldn’t have
noticed. How quick you are! But it does look
exactly like a woman’s hand. The capital R, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
instance”—he flipped the envelope across to her.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that squiggle underneath. I should
have said a rather uneducated female....”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” said Hugh, “he’s a
mining engineer.” And he got up, began to
stretch and then stopped. “I say, what a
glorious morning! Why do I have to go to the
office instead of staying at home and playing with
you?” And he came over to her and locked his
arms round her neck. “Tell me that, little
lovely one.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she leaned against him, “I wish you
could. Life’s arranged badly for people like you
and me. And now you’re going to be late this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said he. “All the rest of the
time’s ours. Every single bit of it. We shan’t
come back from the theatre to find——”</p>

<p>“Our porch black with mining engineers.”
She laughed. Did other people—could other
people—was it possible that any one before had
ever loved as they loved? She squeezed her head
against him—she heard his watch ticking—precious
watch!</p>

<p>“What are those purple floppy flowers in my
bedroom?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Petunias.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“You smell exactly like a petunia.”</p>

<p>And he raised her up. She drew towards
him. “Kiss me,” said he.</p>

<p class="tb">It was her habit to sit on the bottom stair and
watch his final preparations. Strange it should
be so fascinating to see someone brush his hat,
choose a pair of gloves, and give a last quick look
in the round mirror. But it was the same when
he was shaving. Then she loved to curl up on
the hard little couch in his dressing room; she
was as absorbed, as intent as he. How fantastic
he looked, like a pierrot, like a mask, with those
dark eyebrows, liquid eyes and the brush of flesh
colour on his cheek-bones above the lather!
But that was not her chief feeling. No, it was
what she felt on the stairs, too. It was, “So
this is my husband, so this is the man I’ve
married, this is the stranger who walked across
the lawn that afternoon swinging his tennis racket
and bowed, rolling up his shirt-sleeves. This is
not only my lover and my husband, but my
brother, my dearest friend, my playmate, even at
times a kind of very perfect father too. And
here is where we live. Here is his room—and
here is our hall.” She seemed to be showing
their house and him to her other self, the self she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
had been before she had met him. Deeply
admiring, almost awed by so much happiness,
that other self looked on....</p>

<p>“Will I do?” He stood there smiling,
stroking on his gloves. But although he
wouldn’t like her to say the things she often
longed to say about his appearance, she did think
she detected that morning just the very faintest
boyish showing off. Children who know they
are admired look like that at their mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ll do....” Perhaps at that moment
she was proud of him as a mother is proud;
she could have blessed him before he went his
way. Instead she stood in the porch thinking,
“There he goes. The man I’ve married. The
stranger who came across the lawn.” The fact
was never less wonderful....</p>

<p>It was never less wonderful, never. It was
even more wonderful if anything and the reason
was—Mona ran back into the house, into the
drawing-room and sat down to the piano. Oh,
why bother about reasons— She began to sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See, love, I bring thee flowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To charm thy pain!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But joy—joy breathless and exulting thrilled
in her voice, on the word “pain” her lips parted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
in such a happy—dreadfully unsympathetic smile
that she felt quite ashamed. She stopped playing,
she turned round on the piano stool facing
the room. How different it looked in the morning,
how severe and remote. The grey chairs
with the fuchsia-coloured cushions, the black and
gold carpet, the bright green silk curtains might
have belonged to anybody. It was like a stage
setting with the curtain still down. She had no
right to be there, and as she thought that a queer
little chill caught her; it seemed so extraordinary
that anything, even a chair, should turn away
from, should not respond to her happiness.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this room in the morning, I don’t
like it at all,” she decided, and she ran upstairs
to finish dressing. Ran into their big shadowy
bedroom ... and leaned over the starry petunias....</p>

</div>

<p>Something’s happened to me—something
bad. And I don’t know what to do
about it. I don’t see any way out for the
life of me. The worst of it is, I can’t get this
thing into focus—if you know what I mean. I
just feel in a muddle—in the hell of a muddle.
It ought to be plain to anyone that I’m not the
kind of man to get mixed up in a thing like this.
I’m not one of your actor Johnnies, or a chap in
a book. I’m—well, I knew what I was all right
until yesterday. But now—I feel helpless, yes,
that’s the word, helpless. Here I sit, chucking
stones at the sea like a child that’s missed its
mother. And everybody else has cut along home
hours ago and tea’s over and it’s getting on for
time to light the lamp. I shall have to go home
too, sooner or later. I see that, of course. In
fact, would you believe it? at this very moment I
wish I was there in spite of everything. What’s
she doing? My wife, I mean. Has she cleared
away? Or has she stayed there staring at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
table with the plates pushed back? My God!
when I think that I could howl like a dog—if you
know what I mean....</p>

<p>I should have realized it was all U.P. this
morning when she didn’t get up for breakfast.
I did, in a way. But I couldn’t face it. I had
the feeling that if I said nothing special and just
treated it as one of her bad headache days and
went off to the office, by the time I got back this
evening the whole affair would have blown over
somehow. No, that wasn’t it. I felt a bit like
I do now, “helpless.” What was I to do? Just
go on. That was all I could think of. So I took
her up a cup of tea and a couple of slices of thin
bread and butter as per usual on her headache
days. The blind was still down. She was lying
on her back. I think she had a wet handkerchief
on her forehead. I’m not sure, for I couldn’t
look at her. It was a beastly feeling. And she
said in a weak kind of voice, “Put the jug on the
table, will you?” I put it down. I said, “Can
I do anything?” And she said, “No. I’ll be all
right in half an hour.” But her voice, you know!
It did for me. I barged out as quick as I could,
snatched my hat and stick from the hall-stand
and dashed off for the tram.</p>

<p>Here’s a queer thing—you needn’t believe me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
if you don’t want to—the moment I got out of
the house I forgot that about my wife. It was
a splendid morning, soft, with the sun making
silver ducks on the sea. The kind of morning
when you know it’s going to keep hot and fine all
day. Even the tram bell sounded different, and
the little school kids crammed between people’s
knees had bunches of flowers. I don’t know—I
can’t understand why—I just felt happy, but
happy in a way I’d never been before, happy to
beat the band! That wind that had been so
strong the night before was still blowing a bit.
It felt like her—the other—touching me. Yes,
it did. Brought it back, every bit of it. If I
told you how it took me, you’d say I was mad. I
felt reckless—didn’t care if I was late for the
office or not and I wanted to do every one a kindness.
I helped the little kids out of the tram.
One little chap dropped his cap, and when I
picked it up for him and said, “Here,
sonny!” ... well, it was all I could do not to
make a fool of myself.</p>

<p>At the office it was just the same. It seemed
to me I’d never known the fellows at the office
before. When old Fisher came over to my desk
and put down a couple of giant sweet peas as per
usual with his “Beat ’em, old man, beat ’em”—I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
didn’t feel annoyed. I didn’t care that he was
riddled with conceit about his garden. I just
looked at them and I said quietly, “Yes, you’ve
done it this time.” He didn’t know what to
make of it. Came back in about five minutes and
asked me if I had a headache.</p>

<p>And so it went on all day. In the evening I
dashed home with the home-going crowd, pushed
open the gate, saw the hall-door open as it always
is and sat down on the little chair just inside to
take off my boots. My slippers were there, of
course. This seemed to me a good sign. I put
my boots into the rack in the cupboard under the
stairs, changed my office coat and made for the
kitchen. I knew my wife was there. Wait a
bit. The only thing I couldn’t manage was my
whistling as per usual, “I often lie awake and
think, What a dreadful thing is work....” I
had a try, but nothing came of it. Well, I
opened the kitchen-door and said, “Hullo!
How’s everybody?” But as soon as I’d said that—even
before—I knew the worst had happened.
She was standing at the table beating the salad
dressing. And when she looked up and gave a
kind of smile and said “Hullo!” you could have
knocked me down! My wife looked dreadful—there’s
no other word for it. She must have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
crying all day. She’d put some white flour stuff
on her face to take away the marks—but it only
made her look worse. She must have seen I
spotted something, for she caught up the cup of
cream and poured some into the salad bowl—like
she always does, you know, so quick, so neat,
in her own way—and began beating again. I
said, “Is your head better?” But she didn’t seem
to hear. She said, “Are you going to water the
garden before or after supper?” What could I
say? I said, “After,” and went off to the dining-room,
opened the evening paper and sat by the
open window—well, hiding behind that paper, I
suppose.</p>

<p>I shall never forget sitting there. People
passing by, going down the road, sounded so
peaceful. And a man passed with some cows.
I—I envied him. My wife came in and out.
Then she called me to supper and we sat down.
I suppose we ate some cold meat and salad. I
don’t remember. We must have. But neither
of us spoke. It’s like a dream now. Then she
got up, changed the plates, and went to the larder
for the pudding. Do you know what the pudding
was? Well, of course, it wouldn’t mean
anything to you. It was my favorite—the kind
she only made me on special occasions—honey-comb
cream....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_MAN_AND_HIS_DOG">A MAN AND HIS DOG</h2>

</div>

<p>To look at Mr. Potts one would have
thought that there at least went someone
who had nothing to boast about. He
was a little insignificant fellow with a crooked
tie, a hat too small for him and a coat too large.
The brown canvas portfolio that he carried to
and from the Post Office every day was not like
a business man’s portfolio. It was like a child’s
school satchel; it did up even with a round-eyed
button. One imagined there were crumbs and
an apple core inside. And then there was something
funny about his boots, wasn’t there?
Through the laces his coloured socks peeped out.
What the dickens had the chap done with the
tongues? “Fried ’em,” suggested the wit of the
Chesney bus. Poor old Potts! “More likely
buried ’em in his garden.” Under his arm he
clasped an umbrella. And in wet weather when
he put it up, he disappeared completely. He was
not. He was a walking umbrella—no more—the
umbrella became his shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Potts lived in a little bungalow on Chesney
Flat. The bulge of the water tank to one
side gave it a mournful air, like a little bungalow
with the toothache. There was no garden. A
path had been cut in the paddock turf from the
gate to the front door, and two beds, one round,
one oblong, had been cut in what was going to be
the front lawn. Down that path went Potts
every morning at half-past eight and was picked
up by the Chesney bus; up that path walked Potts
every evening while the great kettle of a bus
droned on. In the late evening, when he crept
as far as the gate, eager to smoke a pipe—he
wasn’t allowed to smoke any nearer to the house
than that—so humble, so modest was his air,
that the big, merrily-shining stars seemed to wink
at each other, to laugh, to say, “Look at him!
Let’s throw something!”</p>

<p>When Potts got out of the tram at the Fire
Station to change into the Chesney bus he saw
that something was up. The car was there all
right, but the driver was off his perch; he was flat
on his face half under the engine, and the conductor,
his cap off, sat on a step rolling a cigarette
and looking dreamy. A little group of business
men and a woman clerk or two stood staring at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the empty car; there was something mournful,
pitiful about the way it leaned to one side and
shivered faintly when the driver shook something.
It was like someone who’d had an accident and
tries to say: “Don’t touch me! Don’t come
near me! Don’t hurt me!”</p>

<p>But all this was so familiar—the cars had only
been running to Chesney the last few months—that
nobody said anything, nobody asked anything.
They just waited on the off chance. In
fact, two or three decided to walk it as Potts
came up. But Potts didn’t want to walk unless
he had to. He was tired. He’d been up half
the night rubbing his wife’s chest—she had one of
her mysterious pains—and helping the sleepy servant
girl heat compresses and hot-water bottles
and make tea. The window was blue and the
roosters had started crowing before he lay down
finally with feet like ice. And all this was
familiar, too.</p>

<p>Standing at the edge of the pavement and now
and again changing his brown canvas portfolio
from one hand to the other Potts began to live
over the night before. But it was vague,
shadowy. He saw himself moving like a crab,
down the passage to the cold kitchen and back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
again. The two candles quivered on the dark
chest of drawers, and as he bent over his wife her
big eyes suddenly flashed and she cried:</p>

<p>“I get no sympathy—no sympathy. You only
do it because you have to. Don’t contradict me.
I can see you grudge doing it.”</p>

<p>Trying to soothe her only made matters worse.
There had been an awful scene ending with her
sitting up and saying solemnly with her hand
raised: “Never mind, it will not be for long
now.” But the sound of these words frightened
her so terribly that she flung back on the pillow
and sobbed, “Robert! Robert!” Robert was the
name of the young man to whom she had been
engaged years ago, before she met Potts. And
Potts was very glad to hear him invoked. He
had come to know that meant the crisis was over
and she’d begin to quieten down....</p>

<p>By this time Potts had wheeled round; he had
walked across the pavement to the paling fence
that ran beside. A piece of light grass pushed
through the fence and some slender silky daisies.
Suddenly he saw a bee alight on one of the daisies
and the flower leaned over, swayed, shook, while
the little bee clung and rocked. And as it flew
away the petals fluttered as if joyfully.... Just
for an instant Potts dropped into the world where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
this happened. He brought from it the timid
smile with which he walked back to the car. But
now everybody had disappeared except one young
girl who stood beside the empty car reading.</p>

<p class="tb">At the tail of the procession came Potts in a
cassock so much too large for him that it looked
like a night-shirt and you felt that he ought to
be carrying not a hymn and a prayer book but a
candle. His voice was a very light plaintive
tenor. It surprised everybody. It seemed to
surprise him, too. But it was so plaintive that
when he cried “for the wings, for the wings of a
dove” the ladies in the congregation wanted to
club together and buy him a pair.</p>

<p class="tb">Lino’s nose quivered so pitifully, there was
such a wistful, timid look in his eyes, that Potts’
heart was wrung. But of course he would not
show it. “Well,” he said sternly, “I suppose
you’d better come home.” And he got up off
the bench. Lino got up, too, but stood still, holding
up a paw.</p>

<p>“But there’s one thing,” said Potts, turning
and facing him squarely, “that we’d better be
clear about before you do come. And it’s this.”
He pointed his finger at Lino who started as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
though he expected to be shot. But he kept his
bewildered wistful eyes upon his master. “Stop
this pretence of being a fighting dog,” said Potts
more sternly than ever. “You’re not a fighting
dog. You’re a watch dog. That’s what you
are. Very well. Stick to it. But it’s this infernal
boasting I can’t stand. It’s that that gets
me.”</p>

<p>In the moment’s pause that followed while
Lino and his master looked at each other it was
curious how strong a resemblance was between
them. Then Potts turned again and made for
home.</p>

<p>And timidly, as though falling over his own
paws, Lino followed after the humble little figure
of his master....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUCH_A_SWEET_OLD_LADY">SUCH A SWEET OLD LADY</h2>

</div>

<p>Why did old Mrs. Travers wake so
early nowadays? She would like to
have slept for another three hours
at least. But no, every morning at almost precisely
the same time, at half-past four, she was
wide awake. For—nowadays, again—she woke
always in the same way, with a slight start, a
small shock, lifting her head from the pillow with
a quick glance as if she fancied someone had
called her, or as if she were trying to remember
for certain whether this was the same wallpaper,
the same window she had seen last night before
Warner switched off the light.... Then the
small, silvery head pressed the white pillow again
and just for a moment, before the agony of lying
awake began, old Mrs. Travers was happy. Her
heart quietened down, she breathed deeply, she
even smiled. Yet once more the tide of darkness
had risen, had floated her, had carried her away;
and once more it had ebbed, it had withdrawn,
casting her up where it had found her, shut in by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
the same wallpaper, stared at by the same window—still
safe—still <em>there</em>!</p>

<p>Now the church clock sounded from outside,
slow, languid, faint, as if it chimed the half hour
in its sleep. She felt under the pillow for her
watch; yes, it said the same. Half-past four.
Three and a half hours before Warner came in
with her tea. Oh dear, would she be able to
stand it? She moved her legs restlessly. And,
staring at the prim, severe face of the watch, it
seemed to her that the hands—the minute hand
especially—knew that she was watching them and
held back—just a very little—on purpose....
Very strange, she had never got over the feeling
that watch hated her. It had been Henry’s.
Twenty years ago, when standing by poor
Henry’s bed, she had taken it into her hands for
the first time and wound it, it had felt cold and
heavy. And two days later, when she undid a
hook of her crape bodice and thrust it inside, it
had lain in her bosom like a stone.... It had
never felt at home there. Its place was—ticking,
keeping perfect time, against Henry’s firm
ribs. It had never trusted her, just as he had
never trusted her in those ways. And on the rare
occasions when she had forgotten to wind it, she
had felt a pang of almost terror, and she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
murmured as she fitted the little key: “Forgive
me, Henry!”</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Travers sighed, and pushed the
watch under the pillow again. It seemed to her
that lately this feeling that it hated her had become
more definite.... Perhaps that was because
she looked at it so often, especially now
that she was away from home. Foreign clocks
never go. They are always stopped at twenty
minutes to two. Twenty minutes to two! Such
an unpleasant time, neither one thing nor the
other. If one arrived anywhere lunch was over
and it was too early to expect a cup of tea....
But she mustn’t begin thinking about tea. Old
Mrs. Travers pulled herself up in the bed, and
like a tired baby, she lifted her arms and let them
fall on the eiderdown.</p>

<p>The room was gay with morning light. The
big French window on to the balcony was open
and the palm outside flung its quivering spider-like
shadow over the bedroom walls. Although
their hotel did not face the front, at this early
hour you could smell the sea, you could hear
it breathing, and flying high on golden wings
sea-gulls skimmed past. How peaceful the sky
looked, as though it was tenderly smiling! Far
away—far away from this satin-stripe wallpaper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the glass-covered table, the yellow brocade sofa
and chairs, and the mirrors that showed you
your side view, your back view, your three-quarters
view as well.</p>

<p>Ernestine had been enthusiastic about this
room.</p>

<p>“It’s just the very room for you, Mother!
So bright and attractive and non-depressing!
With a balcony, too, so that on wet days you
can still have your chair outside and look at
those lovely palms. And Gladys can have the
little room adjoining, which makes it so beautifully
easy for Warner to keep her eye on you
both.... You couldn’t have a nicer room, could
you, Mother? I can’t get over that sweet
balcony! So nice for Gladys! Cecil and I
haven’t got one at all....”</p>

<p>But all the same, in spite of Ernestine, she
never sat on that balcony. For some strange
reason that she couldn’t explain she hated looking
at palms. Nasty foreign things, she called them
in her mind. When they were still they drooped,
they looked draggled like immense untidy birds,
and when they moved, they reminded her always
of spiders. Why did they never look just
natural and peaceful and shady like English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
trees? Why were they forever writhing and
twisting or standing sullen? It tired her even to
think of them, or in fact of anything foreign....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HONESTY">HONESTY</h2>

</div>

<p>There was an expression Rupert Henderson
was very fond of using. “If you
want my <em>honest</em> opinion....” He had
an honest opinion on every subject under the sun,
and nothing short of a passion for delivering it.
But Archie Cullen’s pet phrase was “I cannot
<em>honestly</em> say....” Which meant that he had
not really made up his mind. He had not really
made up his mind on any subject whatsoever.
Why? Because he could not. He was unlike
other men. He was minus something—or was
it plus? No matter. He was not in the least
proud of the fact. It depressed him—one might
go so far as to say—terribly at times.</p>

<p>Rupert and Archie lived together. That is
to say, Archie lived in Rupert’s rooms. Oh, he
paid his share, his half in everything; the arrangement
was a purely, strictly business arrangement.
But perhaps it was because Rupert
had invited Archie that Archie remained always—his
guest. They each had a bedroom, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
was a common sitting-room, and a largeish bath-room
which Rupert used as a dressing-room as
well. The first morning after his arrival Archie
had left his sponge in the bath-room, and a moment
after there was a knock at his door and Rupert
said, kindly but firmly, “Your sponge, I
fancy.” The first evening Archie had brought
his tobacco jar into the sitting room and placed
it on a corner of the mantelpiece. Rupert was
reading the newspaper. It was a round china
jar, the surface painted and roughened to represent
a sea-urchin. On the lid was a spray of
china seaweed with two berries for a knob. Archie
was excessively fond of it. But after dinner,
when Rupert took out his pipe and pouch, he
suddenly fixed his eyes on this object, blew
through his moustaches, gasped, and said in a
wondering, astonished voice, “I say! Is that
yours or Mrs. Head’s?” Mrs. Head was their
landlady.</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” said Archie, and he blushed and
smiled just a trifle timidly.</p>

<p>“I <em>say</em>!” said Rupert again—this time very
meaningly.</p>

<p>“Would you rather I....” said Archie, and
he moved in his chair to get up.</p>

<p>“No, no! Certainly not! On no account!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
answered Rupert, and he actually raised his hand.
“But perhaps”—and here he smiled at Archie and
gazed about him—“perhaps we might find some
spot for it that was a trifle less conspicuous.”</p>

<p>The spot was not decided on, however, and
Archie nipped his sole personal possession into
his bedroom as soon as Rupert was out of the
way.</p>

<p>But it was chiefly at meals that the attitude
of host and guest was most marked. For instance,
on each separate occasion, even before
they sat down Rupert said, “Would you mind
cutting the bread, Archie?” Had he not made
such a point of it, it is possible that Archie in
a moment of abstractedness might have grasped
the bread knife.... An unpleasant thought!
Again, Archie was never allowed to serve.
Even at breakfast, the hot dishes and the tea,
both were dispensed by Rupert. True, he half
apologized about the tea; he seemed to feel the necessity
of some slight explanation, there.</p>

<p>“I’m rather a fad about my tea,” said he.
“Some people, females especially, pour in the
milk first. Fatal habit, for more reasons than
one. In my opinion, the cup should be filled
just <em>so</em> and the tea then coloured. Sugar,
Archie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, please,” said Archie, almost bowing over
the table. Rupert was so very impressive.</p>

<p>“But I suppose,” said his friend, “you don’t
notice any of these little things.”</p>

<p>And Archie answered vaguely, stirring, “No,
I don’t suppose I do.”</p>

<p>Rupert sat down and unfolded his napkin.</p>

<p>“It would be very inconsistent with your character
and disposition,” said he genially, “if you
did! Kidneys and bacon? Scrambled eggs?
Either? Both? Which?”</p>

<p>Poor Archie hated scrambled eggs, but,
alas! he was practically certain that scrambled
eggs were expected of him too. This ‘psychological
awareness,’ as Rupert called it, which
existed between them, might after a time make
things a trifle difficult. He felt a little abject
as he murmured, “Eggs, please.” And
he saw by Rupert’s expression that he had
chosen right. Rupert helped him to eggs
largely.</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Psychological awareness ... perhaps it was
that which explained their intimacy. One might
have been tempted to say it was a case of mutual
fascination. But whereas Archie’s reply to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
suggestion would have been a slow “Possibly!”
Rupert would have flouted it at once.</p>

<p>“Fascination! The word’s preposterous in
this connection. What on earth would there be
in Cullen to fascinate me even if I was in the
habit of being fascinated by my fellow-creatures;
which I certainly am not. No, I’ll own I am
deeply interested. I confess my belief is, I understand
him better than anybody else. And if you
want my honest opinion, I am certain that my—my—h’m—influence
over—sympathy for—him—call
it what you like, is all to the good. There
is a psychological awareness.... Moreover, as
a companion, instinctively I find him extremely
agreeable. He stimulates some part of my mind
which is less active without him. But fascination—wide
of the mark, my dear—wide!”</p>

<p>But supposing one remained unconvinced?
Supposing one still played with the idea. Wasn’t
it possible to see Rupert and Archie as the
python and the rabbit keeping house together?
Rupert that handsome, well-fed python with his
moustaches, his glare, his habit of uncoiling before
the fire and swaying against the mantelpiece,
pipe and pouch in hand. And Archie, soft,
hunched, timid, sitting in the lesser armchair,
there and not there, flicking back into the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
at a word but emerging again at a look—with
sudden wholly unexpected starts of playfulness
(instantly suppressed by the python). Of
course, there was no question of anything so
crude and dreadful as the rabbit being eaten by
his housemate. Nevertheless, it was a strange
fact,—after a typical evening the one looked immensely
swelled, benign and refreshed and the
other, pale, small and exhausted.... And more
often than not, Rupert’s final comment was—ominous
this—as he doused his whisky with soda:</p>

<p>“This has been very absorbing, Archie.” And
Archie gasped out, “Oh, <em>very</em>!”</p>

<h3>§</h3>

<p>Archie Cullen was a journalist and the son
of a journalist. He had no private money, no
influential connections, scarcely any friends. His
father had been one of those weak, disappointed,
unsuccessful men who see in their sons a weapon
for themselves. He would get his own back on
life through Archie. Archie would show them
the stuff he—his father was made of. Just you
wait till my son comes along! This, though
highly consoling to Mr. Cullen <i lang="fr">père</i>, was terribly
poor fun for Archie. At two and a half his infant
nose was put to the grindstone and even on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Sundays it was not taken off. Then his father
took him out walking and improved the occasion
by making him spell the shop signs, count the
yachts racing in the harbour, divide them by four
and multiply the result by three.</p>

<p>But the experiment was an amazing success.
Archie turned away from the distractions of life,
shut his ears, folded his feet, sat over the table
with his book and when the holidays came he
didn’t like them; they made him uneasy; so he
went on reading for himself. He was a model
boy. On prize-giving days his father accompanied
him to school, carried the great wad of
stiff books home for him and, flinging them on
the dining-room table, he surveyed them with an
exultant smile. My prizes! The little sacrifice
stared at them, too, through his spectacles, as
other little boys stared at puddings. He ought,
of course, at this juncture to have been rescued
by a doting mother who, though cowed herself,
rose on the....</p>

<p>Of course there would have been no question
of their going to the exhibition if
Father had not had the tickets given to
him. Little girls cannot expect to be given
treats that cost extra money when only to feed
them, buy them clothes, pay for their lessons and
the house they live in takes their kind generous
Father all day and every day working hard from
morning till night—“except Saturday afternoons
and Sundays,” said Susannah.</p>

<p>“Susannah!” Mother was very shocked.
“But do you know what would happen to your
poor Father if he didn’t have a holiday on Saturday
afternoons and Sundays?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Susannah. She looked interested.
“What?”</p>

<p>“He would die,” said their mother impressively.</p>

<p>“Would he?” said Susannah, opening her eyes.
She seemed astounded, and Sylvia and Phyllis,
who were four and five years older than she,
chimed in with, “Of course,” in a very superior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
tone. What a little silly-billy she was not to
know that! They sounded so convinced and
cheerful that their mother felt a little shaken and
hastened to change the subject....</p>

<p>“So that is why,” she said a little vaguely, “you
must each thank Father separately before you
go.”</p>

<p>“And then he will give us the money?” asked
Phyllis.</p>

<p>“And then I shall ask him for whatever is
necessary,” said their mother firmly. She sighed
suddenly and got up. “Run along, children, and
ask Miss Wade to dress you and get ready
herself and then come down to the dining-room.
And now, Susannah, you are not to
let go Miss Wade’s hand from the moment
you are through the gates until you are out
again.”</p>

<p>“Well—what if I go on a horse?” inquired
Susannah.</p>

<p>“Go on a horse—nonsense, child! You’re
much too young for horses! Only big girls and
boys can ride.”</p>

<p>“There’s roosters for small children,” said
Susannah undaunted. “I know, because Irene
Heywood went on one and when she got off she
fell over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“All the more reason why you shouldn’t go
on,” said her mother.</p>

<p>But Susannah looked as though falling over
had no terrors for her. On the contrary.</p>

<p>About the exhibition, however, Sylvia and
Phyllis knew as little as Susannah. It was the
first that had ever come to their town. One
morning, as Miss Wade, their lady help, rushed
them along to the Heywoods’, whose governess
they shared, they had seen carts piled with great
long planks of wood, sacks, what looked like
whole doors, and white flagstaffs, passing through
the wide gate of the Recreation Ground. And
by the time they were bowled home to their dinners,
there were the beginnings of a high thin
fence, dotted with flagstaffs, built all round the
railings. From inside, came a tremendous noise
of hammering, shouting, clanging; a little engine,
hidden away, went <i>Chuff-chuff-chuff</i>. <i>Chuff!</i>
And round, woolly balls of smoke were tossed
over the palings.</p>

<p>First it was the day after the day after tomorrow,
then plain day after tomorrow, then tomorrow,
and at last, the day itself. When Susannah
woke up in the morning, there was a little gold
spot of sunlight watching her from the wall; it
looked as though it had been there for a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
time, waiting to remind her: “It’s today—you’re
going today—this afternoon. Here she is!”</p>

<h3>(<i>Second Version</i>)</h3>

<p>That afternoon they were allowed to cut jugs
and basins out of a draper’s catalogue, and at
tea-time they had real tea in the doll’s tea set
on the table. This was a very nice treat, indeed,
except that the doll’s tea-pot wouldn’t pour out
even after you’d poked a pin down the spout and
blown into it.</p>

<p>But the next afternoon, which was Saturday,
Father came home in high feather. The front
door banged so hard that the whole house shook,
and he shouted to Mother from the hall.</p>

<p>“Oh, how more than good of you, darling!”
cried Mother, “but how unnecessary too. Of
course, they’ll simply love it. But to have spent
all that money! You shouldn’t have done it,
Daddy dear! They’ve totally forgotten all
about it. And what is this! Half-a-crown?”
cried Mother. “No! Two shillings, I see,”
she corrected quickly, “to spend as well. Children!
Children! Come down, downstairs!”</p>

<p>Down they came, Phyllis and Sylvia leading,
Susannah holding on. “Do you know what
Father’s done?” And Mother held up her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
What was she holding? Three cherry tickets
and a green one. “He’s bought you tickets.
You’re to go to the circus, this very afternoon, all
of you, with Miss Wade. What do you say to
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mummy! Lovely! Lovely!” cried
Phyllis and Sylvia.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” said Mother. “Run upstairs.
Run and ask Miss Wade to get you ready. Don’t
dawdle. Up you go! All of you.”</p>

<p>Away flew Phyllis and Sylvia, but still Susannah
stayed where she was at the bottom of the stairs,
hanging her head.</p>

<p>“Go along,” said Mother. And Father said
sharply, “What the devil’s the matter with the
child?”</p>

<p>Susannah’s face quivered. “I don’t want to
go,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“What! Don’t want to go to the Exhibition!
After Father’s—— You naughty, ungrateful
child! Either you go to the Exhibition, Susannah,
or you will be packed off to bed at once.”</p>

<p>Susannah’s head bent low, lower still. All her
little body bent forward. She looked as though
she was going to bow down, to bow down to the
ground, before her kind generous Father and beg
for his forgiveness....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SECOND_VIOLIN">SECOND VIOLIN</h2>

</div>

<p>A February morning, windy, cold, with
chill-looking clouds hurrying over a pale
sky and chill snowdrops for sale in the
grey streets. People look small and shrunken as
they flit by; they look scared as if they were trying
to hide inside their coats from something big
and brutal. The shop doors are closed, the awnings
are furled, and the policemen at the crossings
are lead policemen. Huge empty vans shake
past with a hollow sound; and there is a smell
of soot and wet stone staircases, a raw, grimy
smell....</p>

<p>Flinging her small scarf over her shoulder
again, clasping her violin, Miss Bray darts along
to orchestra practice. She is conscious of her
cold hands, her cold nose and her colder feet.
She can’t feel her toes at all. Her feet are just
little slabs of cold, all of a piece, like the feet of
china dolls. Winter is a terrible time for thin
people—terrible! Why should it hound them
down, fasten on them, worry them so? Why not,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
for a change, take a nip, take a snap at the
fat ones who wouldn’t notice? But no! It
is sleek, warm, cat-like summer that makes the
fat one’s life a misery. Winter is all for
bones....</p>

<p>Threading her way, like a needle, in and out
and along, went Miss Bray, and she thought of
nothing but the cold. She had just come out of
her kitchen, which was pleasantly snug in the
morning, with her gas-fire going for her breakfast
and the window closed. She had just drunk
three large cups of really boiling tea. Surely,
they ought to have warmed her. One always
read in books of people going on their way
warmed and invigorated by even one cup. And
she had had three! How she loved her tea!
She was getting fonder and fonder of it. Stirring
the cup, Miss Bray looked down. A little
fond smile parted her lips, and she breathed tenderly,
“I love my tea.”</p>

<p>But all the same, in spite of the books, it didn’t
keep her warm. Cold! Cold! And now as
she turned the corner she took such a gulp of
damp, cold air that her eyes filled. <i>Yi-yi-yi</i>, a
little dog yelped; he looked as though he’d been
hurt. She hadn’t time to look round, but that
high, sharp yelping soothed her, was a comfort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
even. She could have made just that sound herself.</p>

<p>And here was the Academy. Miss Bray
pressed with all her might against the stiff, sulky
door, squeezed through into the vestibule hung
with pallid notices and concert programmes, and
stumbled up the dusty stairs and along the passage
to the dressing-room. Through the open
door there came such shrill loud laughter, such
high, indifferent voices that it sounded like a play
going on in there. It was hard to believe people
were not laughing and talking like that ... on
purpose. “Excuse me—pardon—sorry,” said
Miss Bray, nudging her way in and looking
quickly round the dingy little room. Her two
friends had not yet come.</p>

<p>The First Violins were there; a dreamy, broad-faced
girl leaned against her ’cello; two Violas
sat on a bench, bent over a music book, and the
Harp, a small grey little person, who only came
occasionally, leaned against a bench and looked
for her pocket in her underskirt....</p>

<p class="tb">“I’ve a run of three twice, ducky,” said Ma,
“a pair of queens make eight, and one for his nob
makes nine.”</p>

<p>With an awful hollow groan Alexander, curling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
his little finger high, pegged nine for Ma.
And “Wait now, wait now,” said she, and her
quick short little hands snatched at the other
cards. “My crib, young man!” She spread
them out, leaned back, twitched her shawl, put
her head on one side. “H’m, not so bad! A
flush of four and a pair!”</p>

<p>“Betrayed! Betrayed!” moaned Alexander,
bowing his dark head over the cribbage board,
“and by a woo-man.” He sighed deeply, shuffled
the cards and said to Ma, “Cut for me, my love!”</p>

<p>Although of course he was only having his joke
like all professional young gentlemen, something
in the tone in which he said “my love!” gave Ma
quite a turn. Her lips trembled as she cut the
cards, she felt a sudden pang as she watched those
long slim fingers dealing.</p>

<p>Ma and Alexander were playing cribbage in
the basement kitchen of number 9 Bolton Street.
It was late, it was on eleven, and Sunday night,
too—shocking! They sat at the kitchen table
that was covered with a worn art serge cloth
spotted with candle grease. On one corner of
it stood three glasses, three spoons, a saucer of
sugar lumps and a bottle of gin. The stove was
still alight, and the lid of the kettle had just begun
to lift, cautiously, stealthily, as though there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
someone inside who wanted to have a peep and
pop back again. On the horse-hair sofa against
the wall by the door, the owner of the third glass
lay asleep, gently snoring. Perhaps because he
had his back to them, perhaps because his feet
poked out from the short overcoat covering him,
he looked forlorn, pathetic, and the long fair
hair covering his collar looked forlorn and pathetic,
too.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Ma, sighing as she put out
two cards and arranged the others in a fan, “such
is life. I little thought when I saw the last of
you this morning that we’d be playing a game together
tonight.”</p>

<p>“The caprice of destiny,” murmured Alexander.
But, as a matter of fact, it was no joking
matter. By some infernal mischance that morning
he and Rinaldo had missed the train that all
the company travelled by. That was bad enough.
But being Sunday, there was no other train until
midnight, and as they had a full rehearsal at 10
o’clock on Monday it meant going by that, or getting
what the company called the beetroot. But
God! what a day it had been. They had left the
luggage at the station and come back to Ma’s,
back to Alexander’s frowsy bedroom with the
bed unmade and water standing about. Rinaldo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
had spent the whole day sitting on the side of
the bed swinging his leg, dropping ash on the
floor and saying, “I wonder what made us lose
that train. Strange we should have lost it. I
bet the others are wondering what made us lose
it, too.” And Alexander had stayed by the window
gazing into the small garden that was so
black with grime even the old lean cat who came
and scraped seemed revolted by it, too. It was
only after Ma had seen the last of her Sunday
visitors....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MR_AND_MRS_WILLIAMS">MR. AND MRS. WILLIAMS</h2>

</div>

<p>That winter Mr. and Mrs. Williams of
The Rowans, Wickenham, Surrey, astonished
their friends by announcing that
they were going for a three weeks’ holiday to
Switzerland. Switzerland! How very enterprising
and exciting! There was quite a flutter
in Wickenham households at the news. Husbands
coming home from the city in the evening
were greeted immediately with:</p>

<p>“My dear, have you heard the news about the
Williams?”</p>

<p>“No! What’s up now?”</p>

<p>“They’re off to Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“Switzerland! What the dickens are they going
there for?”</p>

<p>That, of course, was only the extravagance
of the moment. One knew perfectly well why
people went. But nobody in Wickenham ever
plunged so far away from home at that time of
year. It was not considered “necessary”—as
golf, bridge, a summer holiday at the sea, an account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
at Harrods’ and a small car as soon as one
could afford it, were considered necessary....</p>

<p>“Won’t you find the initial expenditure very
heavy?” asked stout old Mrs. Prean, meeting
Mrs. Williams quite by chance at their nice
obliging grocer’s. And she brushed the crumbs
of a sample cheese biscuit off her broad bosom.</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall get our kit over there,” said Mrs.
Williams.</p>

<p>“Kit” was a word in high favour among the
Wickenham ladies. It was left over from the
war, of course, with “cheery,” “wash-out,”
“Hun,” “Boche,” and “Bolshy.” As a matter
of fact, Bolshy was post-war. But it belonged
to the same mood. (“My dear, my housemaid
is an absolute little Hun, and I’m afraid the cook
is turning Bolshy....”) There was a fascination
in those words. To use them was like opening
one’s Red Cross cupboard again, and gazing
at the remains of the bandages, body-belts, tins of
anti-insectide and so on. One was stirred, one
got a far-away thrill, like the thrill of hearing a
distant band. It reminded you of those exciting,
busy, of course anxious, but tremendous days
when the whole of Wickenham was one united
family. And, although one’s husband was away,
one had for a substitute three large photographs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
of him in uniform. One in a silver frame on the
table by the bed, one in the regimental colours on
the piano, and one in leather to match the dining-room
chairs.</p>

<p>“Cook strongly advised us to buy nothing
here,” went on Mrs. Williams.</p>

<p>“<em>Cook!</em>” cried Mrs. Prean, greatly astounded.
“What can——”</p>

<p>“Oh—<em>Thomas</em> Cook, of course I mean,” said
Mrs. Williams, smiling brightly. Mrs. Prean
subsided.</p>

<p>“But you will surely not depend upon the resources
of a little Swiss village for clothes?” she
persisted, deeply interested, as usual, in other
people’s affairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, certainly not.” Mrs. Williams was
quite shocked. “We shall get all we need in the
way of clothes from Harrods’.”</p>

<p>That was what Mrs. Prean had wished to
hear. That was as it should be.</p>

<p>“The great secret my dear” (she always knew
the great secret), “the great secret,”—and she
put her hand on Mrs. Williams’ arm and spoke
very distinctly—“is plenty of long-sleeved woven
combies!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, m’m.”</p>

<p>Both ladies started. There at their side was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
Mr. Wick, the nice grocer, holding Mrs. Prean’s
parcel by a loop of pink string. Dear me—how
very awkward! He must have ... he couldn’t
possibly not have.... In the emotion of the
moment Mrs. Prean, thinking to gloss it over
tactfully, nodded significantly at Mrs. Williams
and said, accepting the parcel, “And that is what
I always tell my dear son!” But this was too
swift for Mrs. Williams to follow.</p>

<p>Her embarrassment continued, and ordering
the sardines, she just stopped herself from saying
“Three large pairs, Mr. Wick, please,” instead
of “Three large tins.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>As a matter of fact it was Mrs. Williams’ Aunt
Aggie’s happy release which had made their
scheme possible. Happy release it was! After
fifteen years in a wheel-chair passing in and out
of the little house at Ealing she had, to use the
nurse’s expression, “just glided away at the last.”
Glided away ... it sounded as though Aunt
Aggie had taken the wheel-chair with her. One
saw her, in her absurd purple velvet, steering carefully
among the stars and whimpering faintly, as
was her terrestrial wont, when the wheel jolted
over a particularly large one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Aunt Aggie had left her dear niece Gwendolen
two hundred and fifty pounds. Not a vast sum
by any means, but quite a nice little windfall.
Gwendolen, in that dashing mood that only
women know, decided immediately to spend it—part
of it on the house and the rest on a treat for
Gerald. And the lawyer’s letter happening to
come at tea-time together with a copy of the
<cite>Sphere</cite> full of the most fascinating, thrilling
photographs of holiday-makers at Mürren and St.
Moritz and Montana, the question of the treat
was settled.</p>

<p>“You would like to go to Switzerland, wouldn’t
you, Gerald?”</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“You’re—awfully good at skating and all that
kind of thing—aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Fairly.”</p>

<p>“You do feel it’s a thing to be done—don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>But Gwendolen only laughed. That was so
like Gerald. She knew, in his heart of hearts he
was every bit as keen as she was. But he had this
horror of showing his feelings like all men.
Gwendolen understood it perfectly and wouldn’t
have had him different for the world....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll write to Cook’s at once and tell them we
don’t want to go to a very fashionable place, and
we don’t want one of those big jazzy hotels! I’d
much prefer a really small out-of-the-way place
where we could really go in for the sports
seriously.” This was quite untrue, but, like so
many of Gwendolen’s statements, it was made to
please Gerald. “Don’t you agree?”</p>

<p>Gerald lit his pipe for reply.</p>

<p>As you have gathered, the Christian names of
Mr. and Mrs. Williams were Gwendolen and
Gerald. How well they went together! They
sounded married. Gwendolen-Gerald. Gwendolen
wrote them, bracketed, on bits of blotting
paper, on the backs of old envelopes, on
the Stores’ catalogue. They looked married.</p>

<p>Gerald, when they were on their honeymoon,
had made an awfully good joke about them. He
had said one morning, “I say, has it ever struck
you that both our names begin with <i>G</i>? Gwendolen-Gerald.
You’re a <i>G</i>,” and he had pointed
his razor at her—he was shaving—“and I’m a <i>G</i>.
Two <i>Gs</i>. Gee-Gee. See?”</p>

<p>Oh, Gwendolen saw immediately. It was
really most witty. Quite brilliant! And so—sweet
and unexpected of him to have thought of
it. Gee-Gee. Oh, <em>very</em> good! She wished she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
could have told it to people. She had an idea
that some people thought Gerald had not a very
strong sense of humour. All the more precious
for that reason, however.</p>

<p>“My dear, did you think of it at this moment?
I mean—did you just make it up on the spot?”</p>

<p>Gerald, rubbing the lather with a finger, nodded.
“Flashed into my mind while I was soaping my
face,” he said seriously. “It’s a queer thing,”—and
he dipped the razor into the pot of hot
water—“I’ve noticed it before. Shaving gives
me ideas.” It did, indeed, thought Gwendolen....</p>

</div>

<p>Although it sounded all the year
round, although it rang out sometimes
as early as half-past six in the morning,
sometimes as late as half-past ten at night, it was
in the spring, when Bengel’s violet patch just inside
the gate was blue with flowers that that
piano ... made the passers-by not only stop
talking, but slow down, pause, look suddenly—if
they were men—grave, even stern, and if they
were women—dreamy, even sorrowful.</p>

<p>Tarana Street was beautiful in the spring;
there was not a single house without its garden
and trees and a plot of grass big enough to be
called “the lawn.” Over the low painted fences,
you could see, as you ran by, whose daffys were
out, whose wild snowdrop border was over and
who had the biggest hyacinths, so pink and white,
the colour of cocoanut ice. But nobody had
violets that grew, that smelled in the spring sun
like Bengel’s. Did they really smell like that?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Or did you shut your eyes and lean over the fence
because of Edie Bengel’s piano?</p>

<p>A little wind ruffles among the leaves like a
joyful hand looking for the finest flowers; and
the piano sounds gay, tender, laughing. Now a
cloud, like a swan, flies across the sun, the violets
shine cold, like water, and a sudden questioning
cry rings from Edie Bengel’s piano.</p>

<p>... Ah, if life must pass so quickly, why is
the breath of these flowers so sweet? What is
the meaning of this feeling of longing, of sweet
trouble—of flying joy? Goodbye! Farewell!
The young bees lie half awake on the slender
dandelions, silver are the pink tipped arrowy
petals of the daisies; the new grass shakes in the
light. Everything is beginning again, marvellous
as ever, heavenly fair. “Let me stay! Let me
stay!” pleads Edie Bengel’s piano.</p>

<p>It is the afternoon, sunny and still. The blinds
are down in the front to save the carpets, but upstairs
the slats are open and in the golden light
little Mrs. Bengel is feeling under her bed for
the square bonnet box. She is flushed. She feels
timid, excited, like a girl. And now the tissue
paper is parted, her best bonnet, the one trimmed
with a jet butterfly, which reposes on top, is
lifted out and solemnly blown upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>Dipping down to the glass she tries it with
fingers that tremble. She twitches her dolman
round her slender shoulders, clasps her purse
and before leaving the bedroom kneels down a
moment to ask God’s blessing on her “goings
out.” And as she kneels there quivering, she is
rather like a butterfly herself, fanning her wings
before the Lord. When the door is open the
sound of the piano coming up through the silent
house is almost frightening, so bold, so defiant, so
reckless it rolls under Edie’s fingers. And just
for a moment the thought comes to Mrs. Bengel
and is gone again, that there is a stranger with
Edie in the drawing-room, but a fantastic person,
out of a book, a—a—villain. It’s very absurd.
She flits across the hall, turns the door handle and
confronts her flushed daughter. Edie’s hands
drop from the keys. She squeezes them between
her knees, her head is bent, her curls are fallen
forward. She gazes at her mother with brilliant
eyes. There is something painful in that glance,
something very strange. It is dusky in the drawing-room,
the top of the piano is open. Edie has
been playing from memory; it’s as though the air
still tingles.</p>

<p>“I’m going, dear,” said Mrs. Bengel softly, so
softly it is like a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Mother,” came from Edie.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect I shall be long.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bengel lingers. She would very much
like just a word, of sympathy, of understanding,
even from Edie, to cheer her on her way.</p>

<p>But Edie murmurs, “I’ll put the kettle on in
half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Do, dear!” Mrs. Bengel grasped at that
even. A nervous little smile touched her lips.
“I expect I shall want my tea.”</p>

<p>But to that Edie makes no reply; she frowns,
she stretches out a hand, quickly unscrews one of
the piano candle-sticks, lifts off a pink china ring
and screws all tight again. The ring has been
rattling. As the front door bangs softly after
her mother Edie and the piano seem to plunge
together into deep dark water, into waves that
flow over both, relentless. She plays on desperately
until her nose is white and her heart beats.
It is her way of getting over her nervousness and
her way too of praying. Would they accept her?
Would she be allowed to go? Was it possible
that in a week’s time she would be one of Miss
Farmer’s girls, wearing a red and blue hat band,
running up the broad steps leading to the big grey
painted house that buzzed, that hummed as you
went by? Their pew in Church faced Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
Farmer’s boarders. Would she at last know the
names of the girls she had looked at so often?
The pretty pale one with red hair, the dark one
with a fringe, the fair one who held Miss Farmer’s
hand during the sermon?... But after
all....</p>

<p class="tb">It was Edie’s fourteenth birthday. Her
father gave her a silver brooch with a bar of
music, two crotchets, two quavers and a minim
headed by a very twisted treble clef. Her mother
gave her blue satin gloves and two boxes for
gloves and handkerchiefs, hand-painted the glove
box with a sprig of gold roses tying up the capital
G. and the handkerchief box with a marvellously
lifelike butterfly quivering on the capital H.
From the aunts in....</p>

<p class="tb">There was a tree at the corner of Tarana
Street and May Street. It grew so close to the
pavement that the heavy boughs stretched over,
and on that part of the pavement there was always
a fine sifting of minute twigs.</p>

<p class="tb">But in the dusk, lovers parading came into its
shade as into a tent. There, however long they
had been together, they greeted each other again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
with long kisses, with embraces that were sweet
torture, agony to bear, agony to end.</p>

<p class="tb">Edie never knew that Roddie “loved” it,
Roddie never knew that it meant anything to
Edie.</p>

<p class="tb">Roddie, spruce, sleek with water, bumped his
new bike down the wooden steps, through the
gate. He was off for a spin, and looking at that
tree, dark in the glow of evening, he felt the tree
was watching him. He wanted to do marvels,
to astonish, to shock, to amaze it.</p>

<p>Roddie had a complete new outfit for the occasion.
A black serge suit, a black tie, a straw
hat so white it was almost silver, a dazzling white
straw hat with a broad black band. Attached
to the hat there was a thick guard that somehow
reminded one of a fishing line and the little clasp
on the brim was like a fly.... He stood at
the graveside, his legs apart, his hands loosely
clasped, and watched Edie being lowered into the
grave—as a half-grown boy watches anything, a
man at work, or a bicycle accident, or a chap
cleaning a spring-carriage wheel—but suddenly
as the men drew back he gave a violent start,
turned, muttered something to his father and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
dashed away, so fast that people looked positively
frightened, through the cemetery, down the
avenue of dripping clay banks into Tarana Road,
and started pelting for home. His suit was very
tight and hot. It was like a dream. He kept
his head down and his fists clenched, he couldn’t
look up, nothing could have made him look higher
than the tops of the fences—What was he
thinking of as he pressed along? On, on until
the gate was reached, up the steps, in at the front
door, through the hall, up to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Edie!” called Roddie. “Edie, old girl!”</p>

<p>And he gave a low strange squawk and cried
“Edie!” and stared across at Edie’s piano.</p>

<p>But cold, solemn, as if frozen, heavily the
piano stared back at Roddie. Then it answered,
but on its own behalf, on behalf of the house and
the violet patch, the garden, the velvet tree at
the corner of May Street, and all that was delightful:
“There is nobody here of that name,
young man!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WIDOWED">WIDOWED</h2>

</div>

<p>They came down to breakfast next morning
absolutely their own selves. Rosy,
fresh, and just chilled enough by the cold
air blowing through the bedroom windows to be
very ready for hot coffee.</p>

<p>“Nippy.” That was Geraldine’s word as she
buttoned on her orange coat with pink-washed
fingers. “Don’t you find it decidedly nippy?”
And her voice, so matter-of-fact, so natural,
sounded as though they had been married for
years.</p>

<p>Parting his hair with two brushes (marvellous
feat for a woman to watch) in the little round
mirror, he had replied, lightly clapping the
brushes together, “My dear, have you got enough
<em>on</em>?” and he, too, sounded as though well he
knew from the experience of years her habit of
clothing herself underneath in wisps of chiffon
and two satin bows.... Then they ran down
to breakfast, laughing together and terribly startling
the shy parlour-maid who, after talking it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
over with Cook, had decided to be invisible until
she was rung for.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Nellie, I think we shall want
more toast than <em>that</em>,” said the smiling Geraldine
as she hung over the breakfast table. She deliberated—“Ask
Cook to make us four more
pieces, please.”</p>

<p>Marvellous, the parlour-maid thought it was.
And as she closed the door she heard the voice
say, “I do so hate to be short of toast, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>He was standing in the sunny window. Geraldine
went up to him. She put her hand on his
arm and gave it a gentle squeeze. How pleasant
it was to feel that rough man’s tweed again.
Ah, how pleasant! She rubbed her hand
against it, touched it with her cheek, sniffed the
smell.</p>

<p>The window looked out on to flower beds, a
tangle of michaelmas daisies, late dahlias, hanging
heavy, and shaggy little asters. Then there
came a lawn strewn with yellow leaves with a
broad path beyond and a row of gold-fluttering
trees. An old gardener, in woollen mitts, was
sweeping the path, brushing the leaves into a
neat little heap. Now, the broom tucked in his
arm, he fumbled in his coat pocket, brought out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
some matches, and scooping a hole in the leaves
he set fire to them.</p>

<p>Such lovely blue smoke came breathing into
the air through those dry leaves; there was something
so calm and orderly in the way the pile
burned that it was a pleasure to watch. The old
gardener stumped away and came back with a
handful of withered twigs. He flung them on
and stood by, and little light flames began to
flicker.</p>

<p>“I do think,” said Geraldine, “I do think there
is nothing nicer than a real satisfactory fire.”</p>

<p>“Jolly, isn’t it,” he murmured back, and they
went to their first breakfast.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago, thirteen months, to be
exact, she had been standing before the dining-room
window of the little house in Sloane Street.
It looked over the railed gardens. Breakfast
was over, cleared away and done with ... she
had a fat bunch of letters in her hand that she
meant to answer, snugly, over the fire. But before
settling down, the autumn sun, the freshness
had drawn her to the window. Such a perfect
morning for the Row. Jimmie had gone riding.</p>

<p>“Goodbye, dear thing.”</p>

<p>“Goodbye, Gerry mine.” And then the morning
kiss, quick and firm. He looked so handsome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
in his riding kit. She imagined him as she
stood there ... riding. Geraldine was not
very good at imagining things. But there was
mist, a thud of hooves and Jimmie’s moustache
was damp. From the garden there sounded the
creak of a gardener’s barrow. An old man came
into sight with a load of leaves and a broom lying
across. He stopped; he began to sweep.
“What enormous tufts of irises grew in London
gardens,” mused Geraldine. “Why?” And
now the smoke of a real fire ascended.</p>

<p>“There is nothing nicer,” she thought, “than a
really satisfactory fire.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment the telephone bell rang.
Geraldine sat down at Jimmie’s desk to answer
it. It was Major Hunter.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Major. You’re a very early
bird!”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Howard. Yes. I am.”
(Geraldine made a little surprised face at herself.
How odd he sounded!) “Mrs. Howard, I’m
coming round to see you ... now ... I’m
taking a taxi.... Please don’t go out. And—and—”
the voice stammered, “p-please don’t let
the servants go out.”</p>

<p>“<em>Par</em>-don?” This last was so very peculiar,
though the whole thing had been peculiar enough,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
that Geraldine couldn’t believe what she heard.
But he was gone. He had rung off. What on
earth—and putting down the receiver, she took
up a pencil and drew what she always drew when
she sat down before a piece of blotting-paper—the
behind of a little cat with whiskers and tail
complete. Geraldine must have drawn that little
cat hundreds of times, all over the world, in
hotels, in clubs, at steamer desks, waiting at the
Bank. The little cat was her sign, her mark.
She had copied it from a little girl at school
when she thought it most wonderful. And she
never tried anything else. She was ... not very
good at drawing. This particular cat was drawn
with an extra firm pen and even its whiskers
looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Not to let the servants go out!” But she
had never heard anything so peculiar in her life.
She must have made a mistake. Geraldine
couldn’t help a little giggle of amusement. And
why should he tell her he was taking a taxi?
And why—above all—should he be coming to
see her at that hour of the morning?</p>

<p>Then—it came over her—like a flash she remembered
Major Hunter’s mania for old furniture.
They had been discussing it at the Carlton
the last time they lunched together. And he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
said something to Jimmie about some—Jacobean
or Queen Anne—Geraldine knew nothing about
these things—something or other. Could he
possibly be bringing it round? But of course.
He must be. And that explained the remark
about the servants. He wanted them to help
getting it into the house. What a bore! Geraldine
did hope it would tone in. And really, she
must say she thought Major Hunter was taking
a good deal for granted to produce a thing that
size at that hour of the day without a word of
warning. They hardly knew him well enough
for that. Why make such a mystery of it too?
Geraldine hated mysteries. But she had heard
his head was rather troublesome at times ever
since the Somme affair. Perhaps this was one
of his bad days. In that case, a pity Jimmie
was not back. She rang. Mullins answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mullins, I’m expecting Major Hunter in
a few moments. He’s bringing something rather
heavy. He may want you to help with it. And
Cook better be ready, too.”</p>

<p>Geraldine’s manner was slightly lofty with her
servants. She enjoyed carrying things off with
a high hand. All the same Mullins did look
surprised. She seemed to hover for a moment
before she went out. It annoyed Geraldine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
greatly. What was there to be surprised at?
What could have been simpler? she thought, sitting
down to her batch of letters, and the fire,
and the clock and her pen began to whisper together.</p>

<p>There was the taxi—making an enormous
noise at the door. She thought she heard the
driver’s voice, too, arguing. It took her a long
moment to clasp her writing case and to get up
out of the low chair. The bell rang. She went
straight to the dining-room door——</p>

<p>And there was Major Hunter in his riding kit,
coming quickly towards her, and behind him,
through the open door at the bottom of the steps
she saw something big, something grey. It was
an ambulance.</p>

<p>“There’s been an accident,” cried Geraldine
sharply.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Howard.” Major Hunter ran forward.
He put out his icy cold hand and wrung hers.
“You’ll be brave, won’t you?” he said, he pleaded.</p>

<p>But of course she would be brave.</p>

<p>“Is it serious?”</p>

<p>Major Hunter nodded gravely. He said the
one word “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very serious?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>Now he raised his head. He looked her full
in the eyes. She’d never realized until that
moment that he was extraordinarily handsome
though in a melodrama kind of way. “It’s as
bad as it can be, Mrs. Howard,” said Major
Hunter simply. “But—go in there,” he said
hastily and he almost pushed her into her own
dining-room. “We must bring him in—where
can we——”</p>

<p>“Can he be taken upstairs?” asked Geraldine.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes of course.” Major Hunter looked
at her so strangely—so painfully.</p>

<p>“There’s his dressing-room,” said Geraldine.
“It’s on the first floor. I’ll lead the way,” and
she put her hand on the Major’s arm. “It’s
quite all right, Major,” she said, “I’m not going
to break down—” and she actually smiled, a
confident brilliant smile.</p>

<p>To her amazement as Major Hunter turned
away he burst out with, “Ah, my God! I’m so
sorry.”</p>

<p>Poor man. He was quite overcome. “Brandy
afterwards,” thought Geraldine. “Not now, of
course.”</p>

<p>It was a painful moment when she heard those
measured deliberate steps in the hall. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
Geraldine, realizing this was not the moment,
and there was nothing to be gained by it, refrained
from looking.</p>

<p>“This way, Major.” She skimmed on in front,
up the stairs, along the passage; she flung open
the door of Jimmie’s gay living breathing dressing-room
and stood to one side—for Major
Hunter, for the two stretcher-bearers. Only then
she realized that it must be a scalp wound—some
injury to the head. For there was nothing to be
seen of Jimmie; the sheet was pulled right
over....</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
